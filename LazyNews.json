        For marketers, necessary tag information typically includes how long users visit a page on your site, form submissions,
         how they arrived on your site, which links they clicked, or even what products they removed from their shopping cart.
         Each tag tracks something different. For instance, you might create a tag just to see how many people fill out the form on your “Contact Us” page.
          That tag can then send more precise information to Google Analytics, or AdWords, or another third party.`,
