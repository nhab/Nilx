  <p>
    - <b>Windows PowerShell is</b> a command-line shell and scripting language designed
    especially for system administration.
   
   - Windows PowerShell commands, called cmdlets
   
   - PowerShell ISE
   The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is a host application for Windows PowerShell.
   In Windows PowerShell ISE, you can run commands and write, test, and debug scripts 
   in a single Windows-based graphic user interface
    with multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution, context-sensitive help,
     and support for right-to-left languages.
   
     To open it you just go to Start - Search and then Type - PowerShell as shown in the following screenshot.
     Then click on Windows PowerShell ISE. 
     It has three sections, which include - The PowerShell Console with number 1, then Scripting File number 2 and the third is the Command Module where you can find the module.
     
     While creating the script you can run directly and see the result
