            - content must suppplied in most compact way.
    pscychology Laws
        Goal-Gradient Effect
            The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it.
            so show them the progress .
        simplicity
            Hick’s Law :The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
            Jakob’s Law:Users spend most of their time on other sites. 
                This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
        Law of Common Region : 
            Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
        Law of Proximity:
            - Elements in close proximity are perceived to share similar functionality or traits.
            - Proximity helps users understand and organize information faster and more efficiently.
        Law of Prägnanz
            - people are better able to visually process and remember simple figures than complex figures.
            - The human eye simplifies complex shapes by transforming them into a single, unified shape.
        Law of Similarity
            - Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related.
            - Color, shape, and size, orientation and movement can signal that elements belong to the same group 
              and likely share a common meaning or functionality.
            - Ensure that links and navigation systems are visually differentiated from normal text elements.
        Law of Uniform Connectedness
            Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.
        Miller’s Law
            The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
            Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process, understand, and memorize easily.
        Occam’s Razor
            - Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
            - The best method for reducing complexity is to avoid it in the first place.
        Peak-End Rule
            - People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, 
             rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
            - Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments (the “end”) of the user journey.
        Postel’s Law
            - Be  flexible about any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide.
            - Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.
        Serial Position Effect
            Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
        Von Restorff Effect
            when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
        Zeigarnik Effect
            People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

    -Supportive features like tooltips,notifs.faq even live chat
    - trustworthy
    -consistency and connectivity of items

    -topics
// UI Design Elements
    - Color :
        Color theory is arguably the most important visual element in UX design.
        It has the power to influence emotions, and the right color palette on a website
        can increase conversions and overall user satisfaction.
        The knowledge of color wheel usage, color models, color schemes, human optical ability, 
        psychology, and culture is a solid foundation for creating the best color palettes that work.
    - Positive and negative space (Filled and empty areas):
        Negative space makes designs look neat, comfortable, and clutter-free.[
            Adding space around an element increases its discoverability, guides users` eyes,
            and makes it stand out against other, less essential content.
    - Typography 
    - Microcontent
        is a type of UX copywriting that usually communicates a message through a short phrase or text fragment. 
    -motion (animation) : 
        to guides user attention or to add more details

    -shadows 
        to give dimention and feel more matural

    - Imagery 
        has a lot to do with the first impression of an interface and the product`s visual identity. 
        They can impact users` emotions.
        Imagery encompasses the use of photos, illustrations, animations, and videos.
        illustrations are a good fit for representing concepts and abstract things. 
    - Icons 
        To show a text visualy in a glance without paying atttion to details.
    - UI component 
    -layout 
        efers to a frame that holds visual elements (images, text, UI components) on a grid
        to convey a specific message. Grids are invisible intersecting vertical and horizontal lines
        that divide a page into sections.
