<h2>
<pre>
⦿ It is a framework from 	Microsoft for building HTTP (or WCF) services.
⦿ The resources of an application can be manipulated over HTTP using the standard HTTP methods of <b> GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE</b>,
	so you can say that the application supports a web API for other applications to use.
⦿ A <b>resources</b> can be identified through a URI (uniform resource identifier ).
	For example each employee is a resource The URI is <b>http://server/hrapp/employees/12345. </b>
	It includes the employee ID and serves as an identifier to the resource, which is an employee in this case. 
⦿Actions on this resource are accomplished through the HTTP verbs.
⦿ To delete this employee, the request will be an HTTP DELETE request, again on the same URI.
⦿ To create a new employee, the request will be an HTTP POST to the URI without any identifier (http://server/hrapp/employees).
⦿ In the case of POST and PUT, the service must be passed the employee data or the resource representation. 
	It is typically <b>XML or JSON</b> that is sent as the HTTP request message body. 

	An HTTP service sends responses in XML or JSON, similar to the request. 
	For example, a GET to http://server/hrapp/employees/12345 results in a response
	containing JSON representing the employee with an ID of 12345.
	</pre>
	<h2>Status codes</h2>
	<pre>
	HTTP service responds with the HTTP status code indicating success or failure. 
	For example, if the employee  with identifier 12345 does not exist, the HTTP status code of 404 - Not found will be returned.
	If the request is successful, the HTTP status code of 200 - OK will be returned.
</pre>
    
<h2>ApiController</h2>
<pre>
	In your .Net core application,All you need to do is to create a subclass of ApiController, say EmployeesController, 
	with a method of Get(int id) to retrieve the data of the employee and return the employee object in form of JSON or XML.

for post,you need to implement the Post(Employee employee) with a parameter of type Employee.
