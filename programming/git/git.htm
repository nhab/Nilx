 <h2>What is git</h2>
 <div>
 A managable repository (database) of snapshots of working directory(ies).   
 </div>
 
 <h2>Basic Git workflow</h2>
 <div>
 <p>
1- You modify files in <b>working folder</b>.
2- To add those changes to the <b>staging area</b>:
  </p>
  <code>$ git add</code>
 <p>
3- To save the files in the staging area into <b>local Git repository</b>: 
  <pre><code>$ git commit -m "Added x() function to a.cs" </code></pre>
4- To push the changes from local repository to <b>remote repository</b>: 
  </p>
  <pre><code>git push</code></pre>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<div>
<p>
<b>Repository</b>it <strong>stores files and directories plus the history</strong> of their changes.
 
<b>Branch</b> is a version of the repository (A Git project can have more than one branch) .
 
<b>Index</b>is a staging area between the working directory and repository. 
 
<b>HEAD</b> referes to latest commit to the current branch  .it is like current branch. 
 
<b> Detached HEAD</b> refers to a specific revision that is not associated with a branch name. 
 
<b>Master</b>It's a default branch of Git. (in the remote server)
 
<b>Origin</b>is the remote repository from a project was initially cloned. (original repository URL shotened)
 
<b>Remote</b>is a shared remote repository .it could be GitHub.
 
<b>Fork</b>A fork is a rough copy of a repository.
 
<b>tracking branch</b> is a local branch that sync itself  into a remote branch
 
<b>Checkout</b> is used to switch between branches in a repository.
 
 <b>Cherry-Picking</b> is to apply some commit from one branch into another branch
 
<b>Clone</b>makes a copy of the target repository or clone it as local copy 
 
<b>Fetch</b>just "downloads" the changes from the remote to your local repository 
 without merging it to the current local branch(git pull does)
 
<b>Merge</b> combine another branch into current branch .
 
<b>Pull</b> is used to receive data from  remote server to your working directory. 
 
<b>Pull Request</b> announces all the team members that they need to review the code 
 and merge it into the master branch.
 
<b>Push</b>is an act of transfer (overwrite)commits from your local repository to a remote repository.
 
 <b>Rebase</b>is moving or <b>combining a sequence of commits</b> to a new base commit
 
From a content perception, rebasing is a technique of changing the base of your branch from one commit to another
 
<b>Stashing</b>if you don't want to make a commit of half-done work,
 The git stash command saves your work in stash are and enables you to switch branch without committing the current branch.
 
<b>Tag</b>is used to mark a commit stage as important.
 We can tag a commit for future reference.
 Primarily, it is used to mark a projects initial point like v1.1. There are two types of tags.
1.Light-weighted tag 2.Annotated tag
 
<b>Upstream And Downstream</b>
The term upstream and downstream is a reference of the repository. 
Generally, upstream is where you cloned the repository from (the origin) 
 and downstream is any project that integrates your work with other works. 
However, these terms are not restricted to Git repositories.
 
<b>Revert</b>It is an undo type command,bu not completely. is used to revert some commit.  
 
<b>Reset</b>stands for undoing changes. The git reset command is used to reset the changes. 
The git reset command has three core forms of invocation. These forms are as follows: 1.Soft 2.Hard 3.Mixed
 
<b>Ignore</b>used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. 
 It doesn't affect the Files that already tracked by Git.

<b>Diff</b> It is used to show changes between commits, commit, and working tree, etc.

<b>Flow</b> is a branching model for Git, developed by Vincent Driessen.
 It is very well organized to collaborate and scale the development team. 
 Git flow is a collection of Git commands. It accomplishes many repository operations with just single commands.

<b>Squash</b>is used to squash previous commits into one.
 Git squash is an excellent technique to group-specific changes before forwarding them to others.
 You can merge several commits into a single commit with the powerful interactive rebase command.

<b>Rm</b>stands for remove. It is used to remove individual files or a collection of files. 
The key function of git rm is to remove tracked files from the Git index. 
Additionally, it can be used to remove files from both the working directory and staging index.

 # to get difference between local folder and remote folder,first use fetch then use diff:

 $ git diff origin/master # for detailed differences
 
#Syncing with remotes
 $ git fetch origin master # Fetches master from origin
 $ git fetch origin        # Fetches all objects from origin 
 $ git fetch # (=“git fetch origin”).downloads the changes from a remote repo but will not perform a merge on local branch as git pull.
 $ git pull                # (Fetch + merge)retrieve the latest changes made to the remote repository
 $ git push -u origin branch_name #pushs a new branch to a remote repo.-u to create the branch upstream

 $ git branch -r                    # shows the name of all remote branches that Git is tracking for the current repository
 $ git log origin/main    # check the current commits log of a remote repo.
 $ git merge origin/main  # merge a remote repo with local repo(If the remote repository has changes).
 $ git remote update      # get the contents of remote branches without automatically merging.
 $ git push --delete origin branch_name_here      #remove a remote branch.
 $ git push -f       #force a push request: This is usually fine for pull request branches because nobody else should have cloned them.But this isn't something that you want to do with public repos.
