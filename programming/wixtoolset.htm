<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<h3>what?</h3> 
<div>
<p>
The WiX Toolset creates Windows installation packages from XML source code.
It lets developers create <b>installers for Windows Installer</b> ( the Windows installation engine).
To check current version of windows Installer ( msiexec.exe) type:
    <code> msiexec /? </code>
    
    -<b>benifits of installers</b>:
        . All of your executable files can be packaged into one convenient bundle, 
        simplifying deployment Your software is automatically registered with Programs and Features

        . Windows takes care of uninstalling all of the components that make up your product 
            when the user chooses to do so

        . If files for your software are accidently removed, 
        they can be replaced by right-clicking on the MSI file and selecting Repair

        . You can create different versions of your installer
        and detect which version has been installed

        . You can create patches to update only specific areas of your application

        . If something goes wrong while installing your software, 
        the end user's computer can be rolled back to a previous state

        . You can create Wizard-style dialogs to guide the user through the installation

    - <b>Toolset</b>
    It was originally a <b>set of build tools</b> that build Windows Installer packages 
    using the same build concepts as the rest of your product:
    source code is compiled and then linked to create executables;
    in this case 
     &emsp;       .exe setup bundles, 
     &emsp;       .msi installation packages, 
     &emsp;       .msm merge modules, 
     &emsp;       and .msp patches. 
    
- WiX includes several extensions that offer functionality beyond that of Windows Installer.
    For example, 
    &emsp; WiX can install IIS web sites
    &emsp; , create SQL Server databases
    &emsp; , and register exceptions in the Windows Firewall
    &emsp; , among others.

    - With <b>burn.exe</b>, the WiX bootstrapper, 
    you can create setup bundles that install prerequisites 
    like the .NET Framework and other runtimes along with your own product. 
    Burn lets you download packages or combine them into a single downloadable .exe.
    
    - <b>Votive</b> :
    The WiX toolset provides files that update Visual Studio 
    to provide new WiX IntelliSense and project templates.
    There are 7 new project templates:
    <pre>
     &emsp; . Setup Project       : Creates a Windows Installer package from one or more WiX source files.
                It create a new .wxs (WiX source file) for you to add XML markup to
     &emsp; . Merge Module Project: Creates a merge module (MSM) file
     &emsp; . Setup Library Project: Creates a .wixlib library
     &emsp; . Bootstrapper Project : Creates a prerequisite bootstrapper
     &emsp; . C# Custom Action Project: Creates a .NET custom action in C#
     &emsp; . C++ Custom Action Project: Creates an unmanaged C++ custom action
     &emsp; . VB Custom Action Project: Creates a VB.NET custom action
     </pre>
 </p>
</div>

<h3>3 ways of using <b>WiX v4</b></h3>
<div>
   <p>
        1- Visual Studio
        <b>HeatWave Community Edition</b>is released by FireGiant to support WiX v4 SDK-style MSBuild projects in Visual Studio. 
        
        HeatWave supports:

        &emsp; . Conversion of WiX v3 projects and authoring
        &emsp; . Building of WiX v4 SDK-style projects
        &emsp; . Project and item templates
        &emsp; . Property pages to control how the project builds
        HeatWave Community Edition is available free of charge.

    2- Command-line .NET tool
        For example, 
        the build command lets you build MSI packages, bundles, and other package types.

        To install the <b>Wix.exe</b> .NET tool:  (The wix.exe tool requires the .NET SDK, version 6 or later)
        <cl>dotnet tool install --global wix --version 4.0.0</cl>
        
        To verify Wix.exe was successfully installed:
        <cl>wix --version</cl>

    3- MSBuild on the command line and CI/CD build systems( like GitHub Actions )
        SDK-style projects, have smart defaults that make for simple .wixproj project authoring.
        For example, here's a minimal .wixproj 
        that builds an MSI from the .wxs source files in the project directory:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        <Project Sdk="WixToolset.Sdk/4.0.0">
        </Project>
    </code></pre>
</div>

</div>

<h2>In visual studio</h2>
<div>
<p>
download:
    http://www.wixtoolset.org
    https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/tag/wix3112rtm
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WixToolset.WixToolsetVisualStudio2022Extension

Setup:
    After completing the installation, open Visual Studio and go to 
        File | New | Project | Windows Installer XML.

Create
    . Select the Setup Project template from the list of available project types. 
    . The version of .NET that's displayed has no bearing on the project
        since it's comprised of XML mark-up and not .NET code. 
    . Give the project a name and click on OK
    
    The project will initially include a file named <b>Product.wxs</b>  (WiX source), 
    which contains the skeleton markup you'll need to create an installer:
</p>
 <pre><code>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Wix xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/wi">
     <Product Id="*"

     <Fragment>
     <ComponentGroup Id="ProductComponents"

    </Wix>
</code></pre>
<p>
 - WiX 3.9 supports Visual Studio 2013
 
- Even the most minimal installer must have the following XML elements:
   &emsp; .   An XML declaration
   &emsp; .   A Wix element that serves as the root element in your XML document
   &emsp; .   A Product element that is a child to the Wix element,
   &emsp;     but all other elements are children to it
   &emsp; .   A Package element
   &emsp; .   A Media or MediaTemplate element
   &emsp; .   At least one Directory element with at least one child Component element
   &emsp; .   A Feature element
</p>
</div>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<div>
<h3>Burn bundles</h3>
<div>
 <p>
     - The <b>Bundle element</b> is the top-level element for a Burn bundle. 
    -  It contains child elements that let you specify 
   &emsp;&emsp; the chain of packages to be installed 
   &emsp;&emsp; ,the bootstrapper application that provides the user experience
   &emsp;&emsp; ,custom and built-in variables 
   &emsp;&emsp; ,system searches 
   &emsp;&emsp; ,and all the other goodies that let you define a bundle.

        </Chain>

</Wix>
</code></pre>
    
<h3>Bundle package chains</h3>
<div>

    - Burn supports the following kinds of <b>packages</b>:
 <pre>
Package	        Description
-------------------------------------------------------
BundlePackage	Another Burn bundle .exe
ExePackage	    An executable .exe installer
MsiPackage	    A Windows Installer .msi package
MspPackage	    A Windows Installer .msp patch package
MsuPackage	    A Windows update .msu package
    </pre>
    <p>
- To include a package in a bundle's chain of packages:

    . Include the package element as a child of the Chain element.
    . Include the package element as a child of a PackageGroup element 
      and include that package group in the chain with a PackageGroupRef element as a child of the Chain element.
 </p>
 <pre><code>
    <Wix xmlns="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs">
        <Bundle>

<h3>Bootstrapper applications</h3>
<div>
<p>
- Each bundle needs a bootstrapper application to implement the user experience,
  including business logic and UI. 
  
- WiX includes two BAs:
    .<b>WixStandardBootstrapperApplication (WixStdBA) </b> 
      provides a simple, wizard-like UI and typical BA behavior.
      
      The UI is provided by XML files that let you change the appearance 
      without needing to change the code of the BA. 
      
      WixStdBA is written in C++, so has no additional system requirements.
    .<b>WixInternalUIBootstrapperApplication (WixIUIBA) </b>
     provides typical BA behavior and defers the UI to the UI defined in the primary MSI package. 
     
     WixIUIBA is useful when you have a complex UI defined in an MSI package and don't want to convert it to a BA.

- Here's how you might add a built-in BA to a bundle:
</p>
<pre><code>
    <Wix
    xmlns="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs"
    xmlns:bal="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs/bal">

    <Bundle>

        <BootstrapperApplication>
            <bal:WixStandardBootstrapperApplication
                LicenseUrl=""
                Theme="hyperlinkLicense" />
        </BootstrapperApplication>
</code></pre>
<p>
- You can also create an entirely custom bootstrapper application,
 either in native code or managed code. 
 Here's how you might reference a custom native-code BA:
</p>
<pre><code>
<Wix xmlns="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs">
    <Bundle>
        <BootstrapperApplication>
            <BootstrapperApplicationDll
                Id="MyStandardBootstrapperApplication"
                SourceFile="bobstdba.dll" />
            <PayloadGroupRef
                Id="MyStandardBootstrapperApplicationPayloads" />
        </BootstrapperApplication>
</code></pre>
- Here's how you might reference a custom managed-code BA written in .NET 6:
<pre><code>
<Wix
    xmlns="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs"
    xmlns:bal="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs/bal">

    <Bundle>
        <BootstrapperApplication>
            <Payload SourceFile="MyBA.EarliestCoreMBA.deps.json" />
            <Payload SourceFile="MyBA.EarliestCoreMBA.dll"
                bal:BAFactoryAssembly="yes" />
            <Payload SourceFile="MyBA.EarliestCoreMBA.runtimeconfig.json" />
            <Payload SourceFile="mbanative.dll" />
            <Payload SourceFile="WixToolset.Mba.Core.dll" />
            <bal:WixDotNetCoreBootstrapperApplicationHost />
        </BootstrapperApplication>

<h3>The Product element</h3>
<div>
<p>
This is where you define the characteristics of the software you're installing:
its name, language, version, and manufacturer. 

The end user will be able to see these properties by 
right-clicking on your MSI file,
selecting Properties,
and viewing the Summary tab. 

Most of the time,
these values will stay the same from one build of your project to the next.

The exception is when you want to increment the software's version
to indicate that it's an upgrade of a previous installation. 

In that case, you need to only change the Version attribute, and sometimes the Id attribute.
</p>
<pre><code>
<Wix ... >
<Product Id="3E786878-358D-43AD-82D1-1435ADF9F6EA"
Name="Awesome Software"
Language="1033"
Version="1.0.0.0"
Manufacturer="Awesome Company"
UpgradeCode="B414C827-8D81-4B4A-B3B6-
338C06DE3A11">
</Product>
</Wix>
</code></pre>
</div>

</div>

<h3>The Package element</h3>
<div>
<p>
Once you've defined your Product element, the next step is to nest a
Package element inside. An example is shown as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>
<Wix ... >
<Product ... >
<Package InstallerVersion="301"
Compressed="yes"
InstallScope="perMachine"
Manufacturer="Awesome Company"
Description="Installs Awesome Software"
Keywords="Practice,Installer,MSI"
Comments="(c) 2012 Awesome Company" >
<Product>
</Wix>
</code></pre>
Of the attributes shown in this example, only Compressed is really
required. By setting Compressed to yes, you're telling the installer to
package all of the MSI's resources into CAB files. Later, you'll define
these CAB files with Media elements or a MediaTemplate element.
Technically, an Id attribute is also required, but by omitting it you're letting
WiX create one for you.
</div>

<h3>The MediaTemplate element</h3>
<p>
The files that you intend to install are compressed into CAB files and
shipped along with the installer. You decide whether to embed them
inside the MSI or provide them visibly alongside it. In WiX 3.6, a single
MediaTemplate element handles all the details for you, intelligently splitting
your files into the prescribed number of CAB files. Add it after the Package
element, as shown in the following code snippet
</p>
<pre><code>
<Wix …>
<Product … >
<Package … />
<MediaTemplate EmbedCab="yes" >
<Product>
</Wix>
</code></pre>
<p>
The EmbedCab attribute is optional and sets whether the CAB files will be
embedded inside the MSI, the default being to not embed them. Either
way, WiX will create up to 999 CAB files, each holding a maximum of 200
MB of data. You can change that limit with the
MaximumUncompressedMediaSize attribute, set to a size in megabytes. If a
single file is bigger than the maximum, it will be placed into its own CAB
file with enough space to accommodate it.
If you want to split your installation up into several physical disks—
conjure up images of "Please insert disk 2"—you want to use the Media
element instead.
</p>

<h3>The Media element</h3>
<p>
The Media element is an older element that was replaced by
MediaTemplate and if you use one you can't use the other. However, in
some cases, the Media element is the only thing for the job. For each
Media element that you add to your WiX markup, a new CAB file will be
created.
</p>
<pre><code>
<Wix ... >
<Product ... >
<Package ... />
<Media Id="1"
Cabinet="media1.cab"
EmbedCab="yes" >
<Product>
</Wix>
</code></pre>
<p>
Each Media element gets a unique Id attribute to distinguish it in the MSI
Media table. It must be a positive integer. If the files that you add to your
installation package don't explicitly state which CAB file they wish to be
packaged into, they'll default to using a Media element with an Id value of
1. Therefore, your first Media element should always use an Id value of 1.
The Cabinet attribute sets the name of the CAB file. You won't actually
see this unless you set EmbedCab to no, in which case the file will be
shipped alongside the MSI. This is atypical, but might be done to split the
installation files onto several disks.
If you do choose to split the installation up into several physical disks (or
even virtual ISO images), you'll want to add the DiskPrompt and
VolumeLabel attributes. In
</p>

<h3>The Directory element</h3>
<p>
So, now we've defined the identity of the product, set up its package
properties, and told the installer to create a CAB file to package up the
things that we'll eventually install. Then, how do you decide where your
product will get installed to on the end user's computer? How do we set
the default install path, for example, to some folder under Program Files?
When you want to install to C:\Program Files, you can use a sort of
shorthand. There are several directory properties provided by Windows
Installer that will be translated to their true paths at install time. For
example, ProgramFilesFolder usually translates to C:\Program Files

The
following is a list of these built-in directory properties:
</p>
<pre>
Directory property      Actual path
AdminToolsFolder        Full path to directory containing administrative tools
AppDataFolder           Full path to roaming folder for current user
CommonAppDataFolder     Full path to application data for all users
CommonFiles64Folder     Full path to the 64-bit Common Files folder
CommonFilesFolder       Full path to the Common Files folder for current user
DesktopFolder           Full path to the Desktop folder
FavoritesFolder         Full path to the Favorites folder for current user
FontsFolder             Full path to the Fonts folder
LocalAppDataFolder      Full path to folder containing local (non-roaming) applications
MyPicturesFolder        Full path to the Pictures folder
NetHoodFolder           Full path to the NetHood folder
PersonalFolder          Full path to the Documents folder for current user
PrintHoodFolder         Full path to the PrintHood folder
ProgramFiles64Folder    Full path to the 64-bit Program Files folder
ProgramFilesFolder      Full path to 32-bit Program Files folder
ProgramMenuFolder       Full path to Program Menu folder
RecentFolder            Full path to Recent folder
SendToFolder            Full path to the SendTo folder for current user
StartMenuFolder         Full path to the Start Menu folder
StartupFolder           Full path to the Startup folder
System16Folder          Full path to the 16-bit system DLLs folder
System64Folder          Full path to the System64 folder
SystemFolder            Full path to the System folder for current user
TempFolder              Full path to the Temp folder
TemplateFolder          Full path to the Template folder for current user
WindowsFolder           Full path to the Windows folder
</pre>

<h3>The Component element</h3>
<p>
Once you've mapped out the directories that you want to target or create during the installation, 
the next step is to copy files into them.

To really explain things, we'll need something to install. 

So let's create a simple text file and add it to our project's directory. 
We'll call it InstallMe.txt.

For our purposes, it doesn't really matter what's in the text file. 

We just need something for testing.

Windows Installer expects every file to be wrapped up in a component before it's installed.

It doesn't matter what type of file it is either. 

Each gets its own Component element.

Components, which always have a unique GUID, allow Windows to track
every file that gets installed on the end user's computer. 

During an installation, this information is stored away in the registry. 

This lets Windows find every piece of your product
during an uninstall so that your software can be completely removed. 

It also uses it to replace missing files during a repair, 
which you can trigger by right-clicking on an MSI file and selecting Repair.

Each Component element gets a unique GUID via its Guid attribute.

To create a GUID in Visual Studio, go to Tools | Create GUID and copy a new GUID using the registry format. 

The component's Id attribute is up to you. 

It will serve as the primary key for the component in the MSI database, so each one must also be unique:
</p>
<pre><code>
<Component Id="CMP_InstallMeTXT"
Guid="E8A58B7B-F031-4548-9BDD-
7A6796C8460D">
<File Id="FILE_MyProgramDir_InstallMeTXT"
Source="InstallMe.txt"
KeyPath="yes" >
<Component>
</code></pre>
<p>
To add a component to a directory, you have several options. The first,
which is the simplest, is to add your Component elements directly inside
the target Directory element, as given in the following code snippet
</p>
<Directory Id="TARGETDIR"
Name="SourceDir">
<Directory Id="ProgramFilesFolder">
<Directory Id="MyProgramDir"
Name="Install Practice">
<Component Id="CMP_InstallMeTXT"
Guid="E8A58B7B-F031-4548-9BDD-
7A6796C8460D">
<File Id="FILE_MyProgramDir_InstallMeTXT"
Source="InstallMe.txt"
KeyPath="yes" />
</Component>
</Directory>
</Directory>
</Directory>
<pre><code>

</code></pre>
<h3>The File element</h3>
<p>
the actual files inside components are declared with File
elements. The File elements can represent everything from simple text
files to complex DLLs and executables. Remember, you should only
place one file into each component. The following example would add a
file called SomeAssembly.dll to the installation package:
</p>
<pre><code>
<Component ... >
<File Id="FILE_MyProgramDir_SomeAssemblyDLL"
Name="Some Assembly.dll"
Source="SomeAssembly.dll"
KeyPath="yes" >
<Component>
</code></pre>
<p>
A File element should always get the Source attribute. 

Source defines the path to the file during compilation. 

Id, Name, and KeyPath are optional. 
The Id attribute becomes the primary key for a row in the MSI database. 

It should be something unique,
but you might consider starting it with FILE to make it clear that it refers to a File element.

If not set, the Id value will match the filename. 

Name gives you a chance to change the name of the file once it's been copied to the end user's computer.

By default, it will use the name in the Source attribute.

To mark a file as important 
(and that it should be replaced if it goes missing), set it as the KeyPath file for the component.

Since you should only ever place one file inside a component, 
in almost all cases that file should be the KeyPath file. 

If not set, the first file in the component will be the KeyPath file automatically.
</p>

<h3>The Feature element</h3>
<p>
After you've defined your components and the directories that they'll be copied into,
the next step is to define features. 

A feature is a group of components that the user can decide to install all at once.

You'll often see these in an installation dialog as a list of modules, 
called a feature tree , where each is included or excluded from the installation. 

Every component must be included in a feature. Generally, you should
group together components that rely on one another or that form a
complete, self-sufficient unit. That way, if a feature is disabled, you won't
have orphaned files (files that aren't being used) installed onto the
computer. In many instances, if your product doesn't have any optional
parts, you'll only want to create one feature.

<h2>WiX v4</h2>
<div>
<p>
- WiX v4 doesn't have to be installed on every dev machine and build image like WiX v3. 
  Instead, WiX v4 follows the modern .NET model of using NuGet to deliver tools.

- WiX v4 MSBuild projects are SDK-style projects; 
  MSBuild and NuGet work together to bring down the WiX v4 MSBuild SDK NuGet package.

- Both .NET Framework MSBuild and dotnet build are supported.

- To build packages from the command line, 
  WiX v4 is available as a .NET tool, which is also a NuGet package.

- WiX extensions are delivered as NuGet packages, 
  which are usable from both MSBuild projects via PackageReference and the WiX .NET tool.

- For command-line afficionados, 
  most executables have been merged into a single wix.exe tool with commands.
  
  For example, in WiX v3, 
  you might build by calling Candle.exe one or more times to compile your authoring 
  and then calling Light.exe to link and bind the compiled authoring into an .msi package. 
  
  In WiX v4 using wix.exe, that's one command: wix build -o product.msi product.wxs.
</p>

<h3>Convert WiX authoring from the command line</h3>
<div>
<p>
- By default, wix convert converts the files in place, 
  overwriting the original files. 
  
  You can add the <b>--dry-run</b> switch 
   to have <b>wix convert report</b> on what changes it would make without actually making them.

- To convert WiX v3 authoring to WiX v4 from the command line, 
    first install the WiX .NET tool. 
    
    Then you can run <b>wix convert</b>
- To convert an individual WiX source file:
    <b>wix convert path\to\file.wxs</b> .

- To convert all WiX source files in a specified directory:
    <b>wix convert path\to\*.wxs</b> .

- To convert all WiX source,
   include, and localization files in a specified directory:
   <b>wix convert path\to\*.wx?</b> .

- To convert all WiX source, 
  include, and localization files in a specified directory tree: 
  <b>wix convert --recurse path\to\*.wx?</b> .
 </p>
</div>

<h3>Convert WiX projects and authoring from Visual Studio</h3>
<div>
<p>
- <b>FireGiant's HeatWave Community Edition</b> includes support for 
     converting WiX v3 authoring (like using wix convert) 
     and converting WiX v3 .wixproj MSBuild projects to SDK-style WiX v4 projects.

<h2>Signing packages and bundles</h2>
<div>
- Windows Installer packages can be signed directly by signing tools like Signtool.exe.
- However, you can also sign cabinets that are external to the .msi file 
  and include those signatures in the .msi so Windows Installer can verify that the cabinets haven't been tampered with.

<h2>Windows Installer patches</h2>
<div>
- Windows Installer patching allows you to update an installed product without a full upgrade. 
- Patches contain the differences between an older version of a package (called the target) and the newer version (the update).
- Because they contain only the differences, patches are typically smaller than the full update package and typically install more quickly.

<h2>Code Pages</h2>
<div>
When it was first developed and introduced, Windows Installer was available for Windows 95 and Windows 98. 
While the 90s were a great decade, those 16-bit versions of Windows came with some significant limitations.
 One of them is lack of support for Unicode. 
 Windows Installer inherited that limitation 
 and uses code pages to support characters outside of the traditional 7-bit ASCII we know and love.

    So you want to hack on the WiX Toolset? Excellent! WiX development happens on GitHub, so you'll need an account there. 
    You'll need to create a fork of the Git repository for WiX v4 on GitHub and clone it to your development machine.
