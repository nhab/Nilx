<h2>Redux</h2>
<p>
	Redux is a predictable state container for javascript apps:
		-predictable means that you always know from where the state comes from(from the store), 
		who will be able to update it(Actions) and applications behave consistently in different environments
		-state container means it holds all the states.
</p
<h2>Principles of Redux </h2>
<p
	<b>Single source of truth </b>
	   the state of an application is stored in an object tree within a single store
	<b>State is read-only </b>
	   the only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened
	<b>Changes are made with pure functions </b>
	   to specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
</p
<h2>Action Type</h2>
	An action type is a string that simply describes the type of an action. 
	They're commonly stored as constants or collected in enumerations to help reduce typos 
	and because programmers love organization.
 	to structure our action types :
<code>
	export const Actions = {
		GET_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST: 'GET_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST',
		GET_USER_DETAILS_SUCCESS: 'GET_USER_DETAILS_SUCCESS',
		GET_USER_DETAILS_FAILURE: 'GET_USER_DETAILS_FAILURE',
		UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST: 'UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST',
		UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_SUCCESS: 'UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_SUCCESS',
		UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_FAILURE: 'UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_FAILURE',
		// more...
  };

</code>
	
<h2>Payload </h2>
	Payload is a non-official, community accepted (de facto) naming convention for the property
	 that holds the actual data in a Redux action object.

<h2>Action</h2>
	An action is like a message that we send (i.e. dispatch) to our central Redux store. 
	It can literally be anything. But ideally we want to stick to an agreed-upon pattern. 
	And the standard pattern is as follows (this is a TypeScript type declaration):
<code>
	type Action = {
		type: string;    // Actions MUST have a type
		payload?: any;   // Actions MAY have a payload
		meta?: any;      // Actions MAY have meta information
		error?: boolean; // Actions MAY have an error field
				 // when true, payload SHOULD contain an Error
	};
</code>
	
	(The question marks mean the property is optional.
	 So you only need the type property at a minimum).

	An action to fetch the user named Dan might look something like this
<code>
	{
		type: 'GET_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST',
		payload: 'Dan'
	}
</code>
	
	But you don't typically hardcode an action like this. You'd use an action creator.

<h2>Action Creator</h2>
	As you might expect, an action creator usually is a function that creates and returns an action:
<code>
	// in ES5 (also valid in ES6)
	export function getUserDetailsRequest(id) {
  		return {
    		type: Actions.GET_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST,
    		payload: id,
  		};
	}
	// in ES6
	export const getUserDetailsRequest = id => ({
  		type: Actions.GET_USER_DETAILS_REQUEST,
  		payload: id,
	});

</code>
	
<h2>Calling Action Creator</h2>
	When writing basic Redux, an action creator simply returns an action. 
	You would typically dispatch the action to your store immediately:
<code>store.dispatch(getUserDetailsRequest('Dan'));</code>
	

	Although, realistically, you'll be doing this via dispatch properties 
	that are passed into a React component like this:
<code>
	// ES5
	export function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    	return {
        	onClick: function() { dispatch(getUserDetailsRequest('Dan')); }
    	};
	}
	// ES6
	export const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  	onClick: () => dispatch(getUserDetailsRequest('Dan'))
	});

</code>
	
<h2>Reducers</h2>
	Reducers are pure functions taking 2 parameters: the current state and an action  and return a new state.
	Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
	 Remember that actions only describe what happened,
	 but don't describe how the application's state changes.

<h2>STORE</h2>
	A store is an object that brings them together. A store has the following responsibilities:

		Holds application state;
		Allows access to state via getState();
		Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
		Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
		It handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener)

<h2>Basic Example</h2>
The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.

That's it!
<code>
import { createStore } from 'redux'

/**
 * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.
 * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.
 *
 * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,
 * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that
 * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your
 * project.
 */
function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counter)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
// 1
