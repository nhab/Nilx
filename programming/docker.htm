<h2>What is Docker?</h2>
<div>
A platform for building, running and shipping applications in a consistent manner. If the application works on development machine
it can run and function the same way on other machines.

[
	It works on my machine but does not in production environment! Docker solves this problem
	Reasons:
		i) one or more files missing
		ii) software version mismatch
		iii) different configuration settings  
]

With Docker we can 'package' our application and run it on any machine. So all dependencies, configuration etc are going to be
'packaged' and now we can use that package on any environment.
And one thing is worth to mention is if someone joins the team he/she has not spend time to setting up a new machine 
to run the application

Dependencies inside an isolated environment is called Container

One more benefit of Docker is when we are done with an application (container) and we do not want to work on it anymore
we can remove the application and all its dependencies we can do it in one go. Without docker it is hard to remove because we are 
afraid that we would mess up with some application.

Virtual Machines (VMs) vs Containers    (How are containers  different from VMs?)
- In Docker, an app is put to a Container along with all the dependencies of the software, 
these are packed together as a Container Image.
-Docker contains Containers and containers contain Images.
-Since apps kept inside the containers can run on their own therefore developers can work directly on these containers. 
This comes out to be handy for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
-An image is contained by a Docker Container. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container 
using commands send from the docker client to daemon. 
As already discussed, the container is self-sustained, that is – the app kept in the image can run on it’s own without needing anything else from the outside world.

-A Docker Registry stores docker images. We can create a Docker Image on our local pc and then push the image on a docker registry. 
-The 2 famous Docker Registry are:

1. Docker Hub
2. Azure Container Registry
Docker Hub contains millions of docker images which you can pull to your local pc and use them to create great apps.
</div>

<h2>Container</h2>
<div>
An isolated environment for running an application.
Allow running multiple apps in isolation.
Lightweight (They do not need a full OS)
Use OS of the host (They share the host.)
Starts quickly (OS is started on the host) 
Needs less hardware resources	
</div>


<h2>Virtual Machine</h2>
<div>
An abstraction of a machine (physical hardware). We can run several VMs on a real physical machine

A HYPERVISOR is software we use to create and manage virtual machines
Some of the hypervisors: VirtualBox, VMWare (both are cross-platform) Hyper-V (windows only)	
</div>

<h2>Problems with VMs</h2>
<div>

Each VM needs a full-blown(tam gelismis?) OS.
Slow to start (like starting the computer) 
Resource intensive (VMs take an actual physical hardware resources like cpu memory etc.
 -> we have a limit in terms of the number of VMs we can run on a machine.)	
</div>

<h2> Docker Architecture</h2>
 <div>

 Docker uses client-server architecture. 
 Client component talks to the server component using a Restful API. (Server Component: Docker Engine)
 Server component (Docker Engine) takes care of building and running docker containers. 

 Technically a container is just a special kind of process like other processes running on the computer. All containers
 share the OS of the host MORE ACCURATELY containers share the Kernel of the Host. Kernel is Core of an OS. Kernel manages all
 applications and hardware resources. Every OS has its own kernel and that kernels have different APIs, that's why we cannot run
 a windows application on a Linux machine. Because under the hood the application needs to talk the kernel of the OS.

 We can run linux containers on a linux machine. But we cannot run windows containers on a linux machine.
 However we can run windows containers and linux containers on a windows machine. Because Windows 10 has both 
 linux kernel and windows kernel. Windows containers share windows kernel, linux containers share linux kernel.

 </div>
<h2> Installing WSL2 & Docker Desktop</h2>
<div>
Docker runs on linux

Docker Linux platformda calisan bir container platformu [Cikarim: Bu nedenle WSL2 ile ubuntu kurduk] Docker Linux OS e gerek duyuyor.

Docker Desktop kucuk bir VM i ayaga kaldirip Dockeri buraya kuruyor. Docker o sistemde (sistem : Docker Desktop) calisan VM de calisiyordu.

WSL2 destegiyle beraber Windows 10 a linux kernel gomuldugu icin (bir nevi VM gomdugu icin) Docker kendi kurulumunu degistirdi ve WSL2 instance in icine kurulabilir hale geldi

Windows/Mac e Docker kurmak istedigimizde kuracagimiz uygulama Docker Desktop. 	
</div>
<h2>Development Workflow</h2> 
<div>
We add Dockerfile to the application [We 'dockerize' the application] A dockerfile includes instructions that docker uses to package up
this application into an image. Image contains everything the application needs to run.

Docker uses this image to start a container. Application gets loaded inside a container and  this is how the application runs locally
in the development machine. 

We tell to Docker to run the application inside a container/an isolated environment.
We push the image which is on the development machine to Docker Hub and we 'pull' it on to production/test machine. Now these environments
have the same image with development environment. We just say to Docker 'create a container using this image /run it.'

Docker Hub is a storage for images that is created by us/someone.

<b>docker run</b> -- every time when we run it, it creates a container, docker goes to docker hub and pulls down that image, ex: sql server image etc.
<b>docker start [container_id]</b> -- starts an existing container 
<b>docker stop [container_id]</b> -- stops a container
<b>docker ps</b> -- shows running containers
<b>docker push [docker_hub_id/image_name]</b> -- pushes the image to Docker Hub

Images are built up in what called 'layers'. When we upload/pUsh our image to Docker Hub second time, it will be quicker than the first one. 
Because Docker will upload changes/'effect to the layer'
</div>
<h2>What is Kubernetes?</h2> 
<div>
'Onion' --> Layers involved
'Control Mechanism'	
</div>
<h2>Kubernetes: Container Orchestrator</h2>
<div>
We want to make sure that the containers continue to run, 
if containers crash that they get restarted 
or we want to scale them out	
</div>
<h2>What Kubernetes responsible for: </h2>
<div>
Is everything running in the right way?
Scale out in the right way.

We are going to tell Kubernetes how we want Kubernetes to run things
We give Kubernetes like an end state we want Kubernetes to get to.

"DEFINE A DESIRED 'END STATE' LET KUBERNETES FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE"	
</div>

<h2>Docker Compose</h2>
<div>
 middle ground between Docker and Kubernetes. It allows run up multiple containers and network containers together. 

Docker Compose: In Development
Kubernetes: In Production

Kubernetes: K8S 

WE ARE NOT FOCUSING ON HOW KUBERNETES WORKS/COMPOSED 'UNDER THHE HOOD'.
WE ARE FOCUSING ON HOW THINGS WORK ON TOP OF KUBERNETES

Single-node cluster: we just have one 'machine'
[Cluster = Master node + Worker node(s)] master/slave architecture 

Cluster
Node	
</div>

<h2>Pod</h2> 
<div>
- a pod is used to host and run containers (one or more containers) [In our app one pod consists one container]
[
    i) take platform service image, run it on kubernetes in a pod (we are going to do that using 'deployment')
]
Node port - (accessing containers that inside a pod) 'kubernetes service'. in test and development environment. 
external traffic comes into it
and it directs to internal port and through internal port we can access the container inside the pod. ['LOAD BALANCER'] 	
</div>
