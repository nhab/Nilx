<button onclick="toggleAll(this);" >-</button>

<h2>Basic definitions</h2>
<div>
<p>
"Ribbons"
  Are kind of tabbed visual menu which are placed at top of excel just below the menu bar,
  and contains shortcuts for different tasks in excel.
  Excel selects the ribbon's Home tab when you open it.
  
  Tabs
    The default tabs on the ribbon are: 
      File, Home, Insert, Page layout, Formulas, Data, Review, View and Help.

  Groups
    Each tab contains groups of related commands. 
    For example, the Page Layout tab contains the Themes group, the Page Setup group, etc.
    
  -You can collapse the ribbon to get extra space on the screen. 
   Right click anywhere on the ribbon, and then click Collapse the Ribbon (or press CTRL + F1)


"Workbook"
   A workbook is another word for your Excel file.
   When you start Excel, click Blank workbook to create an Excel workbook from scratch.

"Worksheets",
  A worksheet is a collection of cells where you keep and manipulate the data. 
  Each Excel workbook can contain multiple worksheets.
  
"Cells,columns,row"
	To select cell C3, click on the box at the intersection of column C and row 3 .
	To select column C, click on the column C header.
	To select row 3, click on the row 3 header.
	To select the range B2:C4, click on cell B2 and drag it to cell C4

	To select a range of individual cells, hold down CTRL and click on each cell 
	that you want to include in the range.
  
"Range"
   A range in Excel is a collection of two or more cells.
   
  To Fill a Range (to copy first cell to other cells):
    1-Enter the value 2 into cell B2
    2-Select cell B2, click on the lower right corner of cell B2 and drag it down to cell B8
    3-all cell B2 to B8 will be filled with the value of 2.

    if  the B2 has the value 2 and b3 has the value of 4 ,if you drag the lower corner if the last cell
    into following cells,they wil be filled with the values 6,8,10,..
    (excell understand the pattern of first two cells)
    -two first cells can have date value

  To Move a Range
    1. Select a range and click on the border of the range.
    2. Drag the range to its new location.

  <b>Named range </b>
  Select the range, type the name in the Name box(for example prices) and press Enter.
  now youcan use it : =SUM(Pricess)


"Format Cells"
	By formatting we can show the data differently without changing its value.
  When we format cells in Excel, we change the appearance of a number 
  without changing the number itself.
  
  Formatting Cells
    1. Enter the value 0.8 into cell B2
     By default, Excel uses the General format (no specific number format) for numbers.
    2. Select cell B2.
    3. Right click, and then click Format Cells (or press CTRL + 1).
    The 'Format Cells' dialog box appears.
    4. For example, select Currency and click ok.

    Cell B2 still contains the number 0.8. 
    We only changed the appearance of this number. 
    The most frequently used formatting commands are available on the Home tab.

    Percentage Format:
      On the Home tab, in the Number group, click the percentage symbol to apply a Percentage format.
    
    
    Center Alignment:
      On the Home tab, in the Alignment group, center the number.

    Border:
      On the Home tab, in the Font group, add outside borders and change the font color to blue.
  
  
"Find & select"
  
  On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click Find & Select.
  By pressing ctrl+F you search for an expression.By ctrl+h you can replace it.  
  Go To Special
    You can use Excel's Go To Special feature to quickly select all cells 
    with formulas, comments, conditional formatting, constants, data validation, etc.
    
"Tables"

  Insert a Table
    assume we have a data set in cells of a worksheet:
    1. Click any single cell inside the data set.
    2. On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, click Table.
    3. Excel automatically selects the data for you. 
    Check 'My table has headers' checkbox and click on OK.
    Result. Excel creates a nicely formatted table for you. 
    This may still seem like a normal data range to you but
     many powerful features are now just a click of a button away.

  Sort Table example
    To sort by Last Name first and Sales second, execute the following steps.
    1. Click the arrow next to Sales column header and click Sort Smallest to Largest.
    2. Click the arrow next to Last Name and click Sort A to Z.

  Filter Table example
    1. Click the arrow next to Country and only check USA.

  Total Row
    To display a total row at the end of the table, execute the following steps.

    1. First, select a cell inside the table.
    Next, on the Design tab, in the Table Style Options group, check Total Row.

    2. Click any cell in the last row to calculate the Total 
       (Average, Count, Max, Min, Sum etc.) of a column.
     For example, calculate the sum of the Sales column.

Templates"
	Instead of creating an Excel workbook from scratch,
   you can create a workbook based on a template.
   
  Creating workbook based on a template :
    1. On the File tab, click New.

    2. Use the search box to search for online templates or
     click a template from one of the Office templates.

    3. Click Create to download the template.

    Excel creates the workbook Home inventory1.xlsx based on this template.

  Creating a Template :
    
    1. Create a workbook.
    2. On the File tab, click Save As.
    3. Click Browse.
    4. Enter a file name.
    5. Select Excel Template (*.xltx) from the drop-down list of 'save as type'.

"Data Validation",
 Use data validation in Excel to make sure that users enter certain values into a cell.
  
  Create Data Validation Rule
    1. Select cell C2.
    2. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
    3. On the Settings tab of opend dialog box:
    In the Allow list, click Whole number.
    4. In the Data list, click between.
    5. Enter the Minimum and Maximum values.

  Creating Input Message
    Input messages appear when the user selects the cell and tell the user what to enter.

    On the Input Message tab:
    1. Check 'Show input message when cell is selected'.
    2. Enter a title.
    3. Enter an input message.

  Error Alert
    If users ignore the input message and enter a number that is not valid, 
    you can show them an error alert.

    On the Error Alert tab:
    1. Check 'Show error alert after invalid data is entered'.
    2. Enter a title.
    3. Enter an error message.

"Keyboard Shortcuts",

   Keyboard shortcuts allow you to do things with your keyboard instead
   of your mouse to increase your speed.

  - To select the entire range, press CTRL + a 
   (if you press CTRL + a one more time Excel selects the entire sheet).
  - To copy the range, press CTRL + c (to cut a range, press CTRL + x).
     Select cell A6 and press CTRL + v to paste this range.
  - To undo this operation, press CTRL + z
  - To quickly move to the bottom of the range, hold down CTRL and press ↓
  - To quickly move to the right of the range, hold down CTRL and press →
  - To quickly insert the SUM function, press ATL + =, and press Enter.
  - Select cell F2, hold down SHIFT and press ↓ two times.
  - To fill a formula down, press CTRL + d (down)
  Note: in a similar way, you can fill a formula right by pressing CTRL + r (right).
  
"Print"
  
   To Print a Worksheet
    1. On the File tab, click Print.
    2. To preview the other pages that will be printed,
    click 'Next Page' or 'Previous Page' at the bottom of the window.
    3. To print the worksheet, click the big Print button.

  What to Print
    Instead of printing the entire worksheet, you can also print the current selection.
    1. First, select the range of cells you want to print.
    2. Next, under Settings, select Print Selection.
    3. To print the selection, click the big Print button.

    Note: you can also print the active sheets 
    (first select the sheets by holding down CTRL and clicking the sheet tabs) 
    or print the entire workbook. Use the boxes next to Pages 
    (see first screenshot) to only print a few pages of your document. 
    For example, 2 to 2 only prints the second page.

  Multiple Copies
  To print multiple copies, execute the following steps.

  1. Use the arrows next to the Copies box.

  2. If one copy contains multiple pages, you can switch between Collated and Uncollated. 
  For example, if you print 6 copies, Collated prints the entire first copy,
   then the entire second copy, etc. Uncollated prints 6 copies of page 1, 6 copies of page 2, etc

"Share"

  Paste Link
    You can also link the source data in Excel with the destination data in Word. 
    If you change the data in Excel, the data in Word is updated automatically.

    1. Repeat steps 1 to 3 above.
    2. In Word, on the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click Paste.
    In Word, click Paste
    3. Click Paste Special.

 7. Enter a file name and click Save.
 
 Click Save
 
 It requires a password to open this Excel file now. The password for the downloadable Excel file is "easy".  
 
 
"Formulas and Functions"

A formula is an expression which calculates the value of a cell.
   Functions are predefined formulas and are already available in Excel.
   
   Enter a Formula
     
      1. Select a cell.
      2. To let Excel know that you want to enter a formula, type an equal sign (=).
      3. For example, type the formula A1+A2.
      Tip: instead of typing A1 and A2, simply select cell A1 and cell A2.
      4. Change the value of cell A1 to 3.

      Excel automatically recalculates the value of cell A3.
       This is one of Excel's most powerful features!

    Edit a Formula
      When you select a cell, Excel shows the value or formula of the cell in the formula bar.
    
      1. To edit a formula, click in the formula bar and change the formula.
     
      2. Press Enter.
  
    Operator Precedence
      Excel uses a default order in which calculations occur.
      If a part of the formula is in parentheses, that part will be calculated first. 
      It then performs multiplication or division calculations. 
      Once this is complete, Excel will add and subtract the remainder of your formula. 
      See the example below.

      First, Excel performs multiplication (A1 * A2). 
      Next, Excel adds the value of cell A3 to this result.
      
      Another example:
      First, Excel calculates the part in parentheses (A2+A3). 
      Next, it multiplies this result by the value of cell A1.

    Copy/Paste a Formula
      When you copy a formula, Excel automatically adjusts the cell references for each new cell 
      the formula is copied to. 
      To understand this, execute the following steps.

      1. Enter the formula shown below into cell A4.

      2a. Select cell A4, right click, and then click Copy (or press CTRL + c)...

      ...next, select cell B4, right click, and then click Paste under 'Paste Options:'
       (or press CTRL + v).

      2b. You can also drag the formula to cell B4. 
      Select cell A4, click on the lower right corner of cell A4 and drag it across to cell B4. 
      This is much easier and gives the exact same result!

      Result. The formula in cell B4 references the values in column B.


    Insert Function
      Every function has the same structure. For example, SUM(A1:A4). 
      The name of this function is SUM. The part between the brackets (arguments)
       means we give Excel the range A1:A4 as input.
      This function adds the values in cells A1, A2, A3 and A4.
      It's not easy to remember which function and which arguments to use for each task. 
      Fortunately, the Insert Function feature in Excel helps you with this.

      To insert a function, execute the following steps:

      1. Select a cell.

      2. Click the Insert Function button.

      The 'Insert Function' dialog box appears.

      3. Search for a function or select a function from a category. 
      For example, choose COUNTIF from the Statistical category.
      4. Click OK.

      The 'Function Arguments' dialog box appears.

      5. Click in the Range box and select the range A1:C2.

      6. Click in the Criteria box and type >5.

      7. Click OK.

      Result. The COUNTIF function counts the number of cells that are greater than 5.

      Note: instead of using the Insert Function feature, simply type =COUNTIF(A1:C2,">5"). 
      When you arrive at: =COUNTIF( instead of typing A1:C2, simply select the range A1:C2.

Lookup & Reference"

  Vlookup
    The VLOOKUP (Vertical lookup) function looks for a value(i.e  104)
    in the leftmost column of a table(i.e Id column), and then returns a value in the same row
      from another column you specify(i.e column 3).
    
        =VLOOKUP(A2,$E$4:$G$7,3,FALSE)

    Explanation:
    the VLOOKUP function looks for the ID (104) in the leftmost column of the range $E$4:$G$7 
    and returns the value in the same row from the third column (third argument is set to 3).
    The fourth argument is set to FALSE to return an exact match or a #N/A error if not found.

   Hlookup
    In a similar way, you can use the HLOOKUP (Horizontal lookup) function.

      =HLOOKUP(A2,$E$4:$H$6,3,FALSE)


    Match
      The MATCH function returns the position of a value in a given range.

      =MATCH(A2,E4:E7,0)

      argument to 0 to return the position of the value that is 
      exactly equal to lookup_value (A2) or a #N/A error if not found.

    Index
      Returns a the value at given coordination in a two-dimensional range.

          =Index(E4:F7,A2,B2)

      it returns the intersection of row 3 and column 2 in the range E4:F7.

      Choose
        Returns a value from a list of values, based on a position number.

          =CHOOSE(3,"car","Boat","plane")

        returns plane

"Financial"

  FV 
    calculates the future value of an investment based on a constant interest rate. 
    You can use FV with either periodic, constant payments, or a single lump sum payment.
    <pre><code>
      =FV(interest_rate,totper,payment,[present_value],[type])
    </code></pre>
    arguments:

Rate    Required. The interest rate per period.

Nper    Required. The total number of payment periods in an annuity.

Pmt    Required. The payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the annuity.
      Typically, pmt contains principal and interest but no other fees or taxes. 
      If pmt is omitted, you must include the pv argument.

Pv    Optional. The present value, or the lump-sum amount that a series of future payments
     is worth right now. If pv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), 
     and you must include the pmt argument.

Type    Optional. The number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due. 
      If type is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.
      0 is At the end of the period
      1 At the beginning of the period

    Excel formula coach is an online tool dedicated to it:
    https://support.content.office.net/en-us/coach/excelcoach_FV_PartI.html

To illustrate Excel's most popular financial functions, we consider
  a loan with monthly payments,
  an annual interest rate of 6%, 
  a 20-year duration, 
  a present value of $150,000 (amount borrowed)
  and a future value of 0 (that's what you hope to achieve when you pay off a loan).

  We make monthly payments, so we use 6%/12 = 0.5% for Rate 
  and 20*12 = 240 for Nper (total number of periods). 
  If we make annual payments on the same loan, we use 6% for Rate and 20 for Nper.

PMT
  calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.
  PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])
 
  Note: the last two arguments are optional. 
  For loans, Fv can be omitted (the future value of a loan equals 0, however, 
  it's included here for clarification). If Type is omitted, 
  it is assumed that payments are due at the end of the period.

  Result. The monthly payment equals $1,074.65.

  Tip: when working with financial functions in Excel, always ask yourself the question,
  am I making a payment (negative) or am I receiving money (positive)?
    We pay off a loan of $150,000 (positive, we received that amount)
    and we make monthly payments of $1,074.65 (negative, we pay).
      Visit our page about the PMT function for many more examples.

RATE
  Returns the interest rate per period of an annuity.
  RATE is calculated by iteration and can have zero or more solutions. 
  If the successive results of RATE do not converge to within 0.0000001 after 20 iterations,
  RATE returns the #NUM! error value.

NPER
  Or the NPER function. If we make monthly payments of $1,074.65 on a 20-year loan,
  with an annual interest rate of 6%, it takes 240 months to pay off this loan.

  We already knew this, but we can change the monthly payment now to see how this affects 
  the total number of periods.

  Conclusion: if we make monthly payments of $2,074.65, it takes less than 90 months 
  to pay off this loan.

PV
  Or the PV (Present Value) function. If we make monthly payments of $1,074.65 on a 20-year loan,
  with an annual interest rate of 6%, how much can we borrow? You already know the answer.

FV
  And we finish this chapter with the FV (Future Value) function.
  If we make monthly payments of $1,074.65 on a 20-year loan,
  with an annual interest rate of 6%, do we pay off this loan? Yes.

  But, if we make monthly payments of only $1,000.00, we still have debt after 20 years.


"Statistical "

  Average
    To calculate the average of a group of numbers, use the AVERAGE function.
    <pre><code>
      =AVERAGE(A1:O1)
    </code></pre>

  Averageif
    To average cells based on one criteria, use the AVERAGEIF function. 
    For example, to calculate the average excluding zeros.
    <pre><code>
      =averageif(a1:o1,"<>0")
    </code></pre>

  Median
    To find the median (or middle number), use the MEDIAN function.

  Mode
    To find the most frequently occurring number, use the MODE function.
    
  Standard Deviation
    To calculate the standard deviation Of a Range, use the STEDV function.
  
  Min
    To find the minimum value, use the MIN function.
    
  Max
    To find the maximum value, use the MAX function.

  Large
    To find the third largest number, use the following LARGE function :
    <pre><code>
      =LARGE(A1:O1,3)
    </code></pre>

    Small
      To find the second smallest number, use the following SMALL function

"Round "

  Round
      The ROUND function in Excel rounds a number to a specified number of digits.
      The ROUND function rounds up or down. 1, 2, 3 and 4 get rounded down.
      5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 get rounded up.

       For example, round a number to three decimal places.
      =ROUND(114.7261,3) is 114.72 

  RoundUp
    The ROUNDUP function in Excel always rounds a number up (away from zero).
     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 get rounded up

  RoundDown
    The ROUNDDOWN function in Excel always rounds a number down (toward zero).
     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 get rounded down.

"Formula Errors"

      ##### error
        When your cell contains this error code, the column isn't wide enough to display the value.

      #NAME? error
        The #NAME? error occurs when Excel does not recognize text in a formula.

      #VALUE! error
        Excel displays the #VALUE! error when a formula has the wrong type of argument.

      #DIV/0! error
        Excel displays the #DIV/0! error when a formula tries to divide a number
         by 0 or an empty cell.

      #REF! error
        Excel displays the #REF! error when a formula refers to a cell that is not valid.
        `   ,

"Conditional Formatting"

  Conditional formatting in Excel enables you to highlight cells 
  with a certain color, depending on the cell's value.

<b>Highlight Cells :</b>
    To highlight cells that are greater than a value, execute the following steps.

    1. Select the range A1:A10.
    2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting.
    3. Click Highlight Cells Rules, Greater Than.
    4. Enter the value <strong>80</strong> and select a formatting style.
    5. Click OK.

"Pivot Tables"

what is a pivot table?
  You can think of a pivot table as an interactive reprot.
  With very little effort (and no formulas) you can look at the same data
  from many different perspectives 
  by dragging fields from one axes to the other. 

  You can group data into categories,
  break down data into years and months, 
  filter data to include or exclude categories, and even build charts.
 <img src='https://www.exceltip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25.gif' />
<b>Insert a Pivot Table:</b>
  assume Our data set consists of 213 records and 6 fields. 
  Order ID, Product, Category, Amount, Date and Country:

  <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/pivot-tables/pivot-table-data.png'/>

  1. Click any single cell inside the data set.
  2. On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, click PivotTable  and ok
    Excel automatically selects the data for you.
    The default location for a new pivot table is New Worksheet.

<b>Drag fields:</b>

  The PivotTable Fields pane appears. 
  To get the total amount exported of each product, 
  drag the following fields to the different areas in the dialog box:

<img  src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/pivot-tables/drag-fields-areas.png' />
  
  1. Product field to the Rows area.
  2. Amount field to the Values area.
  3. Country field to the Filters area.

  Below you can find the resulting pivot table. 
  Bananas are our main export product. 

  <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/pivot-tables/pivot-table.png' />

<b>Sort</b>
  To get Banana at the top of the list, sort the pivot table.
  1. Click any cell inside the Sum of Amount column.
  2. Right click and click on Sort, Sort Largest to Smallest.
 
<b>Filter</b>
  Because we added the Country field to the Filters area,
  we can filter this pivot table by Country.
  For example, which products do we export the most to France?

  1. Click the filter drop-down and select France.

  Note: you can use the standard filter (triangle next to Row Labels)
   to only show the amounts of specific products.

<b>Change Summary Calculation</b>
  By default, Excel summarizes your data by either summing or counting the items.
  To change the type of calculation that you want to use, execute the following steps.

  1. Click any cell inside the Sum of Amount column.
  2. Right click and click on Value Field Settings.
  3. Choose the type of calculation you want to use. For example, click Count and then ok.
  Result. 16 out of the 28 orders to France were 'Apple' orders.


<b>Two-dimensional Pivot Table</b>
  If you drag a field to the Rows area and Columns area, 
  you can create a two-dimensional pivot table. 
  First, insert a pivot table. 
  Next, to get the total amount exported to each country,
  of each product, drag the following fields to the different areas.

  1. Country field to the Rows area.
  2. Product field to the Columns area.
  3. Amount field to the Values area.
  4. Category field to the Filters area.

Tables

  Tables allow you to analyze your data in Excel quickly and easily.
   Learn how to insert, sort and filter a table, 
   and how to display a total row at the end of a table.

  Insert a Table:
    1. Click any single cell inside the data set.
    2. On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, click Table.
    3. Excel automatically selects the data for you. Check 'My table has headers' and click on OK.
    4.Result. Excel creates a nicely formatted table for you.
     This may still seem like a normal data range to you 
     but many powerful features like filter,sort and total are now just a click of a button away.


"What-If Analysis"

    allows you to try out different values (scenarios) for formulas. 
    
    Assume you own a book store 
    you have 100 books. 
      
    If you sell 60% for the highest price of $50 , 
    and a remaining 40% for the lower price of $20.
    cell D10 calculates a total profit of 60 * $50 + 40 * $20 = $3800.
    
    <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/what-if-analysis/what-if-analysis-example.png' />

  <b>Create Different Scenarios</b>
    But what if you sell 70% for the highest price?
    And what if you sell 80% for the highest price?
    Each different percentage is a different scenario. 
    You can use the Scenario Manager to create these scenarios.
    You can simply type in a different percentage into cell C4 to see the corresponding result
    of a scenario in cell D10.
    However, what-if analysis <strong>enables you to easily compare</strong> the results of different scenarios. 
    
    1. On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click What-If Analysis.
    2. Click Scenario Manager.
        The Scenario Manager dialog box appears.
    3. Add a scenario by clicking on Add.
    4. Type a name, select cell C4 (% sold for the highest price) for the Changing cells
     and click on OK.

    5. Enter the corresponding value 0.6 and click on OK again.
    6. Next, add 4 other scenarios (70%, 80%, 90% and 100%).
    <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/what-if-analysis/all-scenarios.png' />
    Note: to see the result of a scenario, select the scenario and click on the Show button. 
    Excel will change the value of cell C4 accordingly for you 
    to see the corresponding result on the sheet.

    result:
    <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/what-if-analysis/scenario-summary.png' />

<b>Goal Seek</b>
    What if you want to know
     how many books you need to sell for the highest price,
     to obtain a total profit of exactly $4700? 
     You can use Excel's Goal Seek feature to find the answer.

    1. On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click What-If Analysis.
    The Goal Seek dialog box appears.
    2.click goal seek.
    3. Select cell D10.
    4. Click in the 'To value' box and type 4700.
    5. Click in the 'By changing cell' box and select cell C4.
    6. Click OK.

    Result. You need to sell 90% of the books for the highest price 
    to obtain a total profit of exactly $4700.
    <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/what-if-analysis/goal-seek-result.png' />

"Solver"

  <b>Solver</b>

    Finds optimal solutions for all kind of decision problems.
  
  <b>Load the Solver Add-in</b>

    To load the solver add-in, execute the following steps.

    1. On the File tab, click Options.
    2. Under Add-ins, select Solver Add-in and click on the Go button.
    3. Check Solver Add-in and click OK.
    4. You can find the Solver on the Data tab, in the Analyze group

  <b>Formulate the Model</b>

    The model we are going to solve looks as follows in Excel.
    <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/solver/formulate-model.png' />

    1. To formulate this linear programming model, answer the following three questions.

    a. What are the decisions to be made?
       For this problem, we need Excel to find out how much to order of each product 
       (bicycles, mopeds and child seats).
    
    b. What are the constraints on these decisions? 
        The constrains here are that the amount of capital and storage used by the products 
        cannot exceed the limited amount of capital and storage (resources) available. 
        For example, each bicycle uses 300 units of capital and 0.5 unit of storage.
    
    c. What is the overall measure of performance for these decisions? 
      The overall measure of performance is the total profit of the three products, 
      so the objective is to maximize this quantity.

    2. To make the model easier to understand, create the following named ranges.
    Range Name	         Cells
    UnitProfit	        C4:E4
    OrderSize	          C12:E12
    ResourcesUsed	      G7:G8
    ResourcesAvailable	I7:I8
    TotalProfit	        I12

    3. Insert the following three SUMPRODUCT functions.
      =DumProduct(c7:E7,OrderSize)
      =DumProduct(c8:E8,OrderSize)
      <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/solver/sumproduct-functions.png' />
    
      Explanation: 
      The amount of capital used equals the sumproduct of the range C7:E7 and OrderSize. 
       The amount of storage used equals the sumproduct of the range C8:E8 and OrderSize.
      Total Profit equals the sumproduct of UnitProfit and OrderSize.
  Trial and Error
    With this formulation, it becomes easy to analyze any trial solution.
    For example, if we order 20 bicycles, 40 mopeds and 100 child seats, 
    the total amount of resources used does not exceed the amount of resources available. 
    This solution has a total profit of 19000.

    It is not necessary to use trial and error. We shall describe next how the Excel Solver can be used to quickly find the optimal solution.

Solve the Model
    To find the optimal solution, execute the following steps.
    1. On the Data tab, in the Analyze group, click Solver.
    Enter the solver parameters (read on). The result should be consistent with the picture below.
    <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/solver/solver-parameters.png' />

    You have the choice of typing the range names or clicking on the cells in the spreadsheet.

    2. Enter TotalProfit for the Objective.

    3. Click Max.

    4. Enter OrderSize for the Changing Variable Cells.

    5. Click Add to enter the following constraint.

    6. Check 'Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative' and select 'Simplex LP'.

    7. Finally, click Solve.

    Result:
      <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/solver/solver-results.png' />

      The optimal solution:

      <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/solver/optimal-solution.png' />

     Conclusion:
      it is optimal to order 94 bicycles and 54 mopeds.
      This solution gives the maximum profit of 25600. 
      This solution uses all the resources available.

      <h2>Workbook and Worksheet Object</h2>
<p>
      <b>Object Hierarchy</b>
        In Excel VBA, an object can contain another object, 
        and that object can contain another object, etc. 
        
        In other words, Excel VBA programming involves working with an object hierarchy. 
        
        The mother of all objects is Excel itself. 
        We call it the Application object. 
        The application object contains other objects. 
        For example, the Workbook object (Excel file). 
        This can be any workbook you have created. 
        The Workbook object contains other objects, such as the Worksheet object. 
        The Worksheet object contains other objects, such as the Range object.

        We used the following code line:
   
          Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
   
        but what we really meant was:
   
        Application.Workbooks("create-a-macro").Worksheets(1).Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
   
      Note: the objects are connected with a dot. 
      Fortunately, we do not have to add a code line this way.
       That is because we placed our command button in create-a-macro.xlsm, on the first worksheet. 
       Be aware that if you want to change things on different worksheets, 
       you have to include the Worksheet object. Read on.
</p>
    <b>Cells</b>
       <pre><code>
        Cells(3, 2).Value = 2
        Range(Cells(1, 1), Cells(4, 1)).Value = 5
     </code></pre> 
<p>
<b>Collections</b>
      You may have noticed that Workbooks and Worksheets are both plural. 
      That is because they are collections. 
      The Workbooks collection contains all the Workbook objects that are currently open. 
      The Worksheets collection contains all the Worksheet objects in a workbook.

      You can refer to a member of the collection, 
      (for example, a single Worksheet object)
       in 3 ways:

          1. Using the worksheet name.
           
              Worksheets("Sales").Range("A1").Value = "Hello"

          2. Using the index number (1 is the first worksheet starting from the left).

              Worksheets(1).Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
          

          3. Using the CodeName.
   
              Sheet1.Range("A1").Value = "Hello"

            To see the CodeName of a worksheet, open the Visual Basic Editor. 
            In the Project Explorer, the first name is the CodeName. 
            The second name is the worksheet name (Sales).
            the CodeName remains the same if you change the worksheet name
             or the order of your worksheets so this is the safest way to reference a worksheet.
            Click View, Properties Window to change the CodeName of a worksheet.
            There is one disadvantage, you cannot use the CodeName
             if you reference a worksheet in a different workbook.

      -The Add method of the Workbooks collection creates a new workbook:
          
            Workbooks.Add
            MsgBox Worksheets.Count
        
        
  <b>Range Object</b>
      The Range object, is the representation of  cell(s) on your worksheet.
      Properties are something which an object has
      while methods do something .

      Setting a cell value:
      
        Range("B3").Value = 2
      
      Setting value to a range:
      
        Range("A1:A4").Value = 5
      
      Setting value to 2 ranges:
     
      
      Range("A1:A2,B3:C4").Value = 10
      
      <img src='https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/images/range-object/range-example-3.png' />

      named range:
      ange("Prices").Value = 15

      Declaring a Range object:
      </p>
        <pre><code>
          Dim example As Range
          Set example = Range("A1:C4")

          example.Value = 8
        </code></pre>
   <p> 
   <b>Select</b>
   
    The Select method of a range,simply selects the range.
 
    Code:
</p>
   <pre><code>
      Dim example As Range
      Set example = Range("A1:C4")

      example.Select
    </code></pre>   

    Note: to select cells on a different worksheet, you have to activate this sheet first. 
    For example, the following code lines select cell B7 on the third worksheet from the left
  <pre><code>
    Worksheets(3).Activate
    Worksheets(3).Range("B7").Select
    </code></pre> 

    <b>Rows and columns</b>
    <pre><code>
      Dim example As Range
      Set example = Range("A1:C4")
      example.Rows(3).Select  

      Dim example2 As Range
      Set example2 = Range("A1:C4")

      example2.Columns(2).Select
    </code></pre> 

    <b>Copy/Paste</b>
       The Copy and Paste method are used to copy a range and to paste it somewhere else 
      on the worksheet: 
    <pre><code>
  

      Range("A1:A2").Select
      Selection.Copy

      Range("C3").Select
      ActiveSheet.Paste

      The easy way to do the same thing:
      Range("C3:C4").Value = Range("A1:A2").Value
    </code></pre>

    <b>Clear</b>
      To clear the content of an Excel range, you can use the ClearContents method.
    <pre><code>
      Range("A1").ClearContents
      or simply use:

      Range("A1").Value = ""
      </code></pre> 
  <b>Count</b>
  With the Count property, you can count the number of cells, rows and columns of a range.
    <pre><code>
      Dim example As Range
      Set example = Range("A1:C4")

      MsgBox example.Count  
      
      MsgBox example.Rows.Count
    </code></pre> 

<b>Loops</b>
    <pre><code>
      Dim i As Integer
      i = 1

      Do While Cells(i, 1).Value <> ""
          Cells(i, 2).Value = Cells(i, 1).Value + 10
          i = i + 1
      Loop
    </pre></code>

<b>Date and Time</b>
<pre><code>
    Dim exampleDate As Date

    exampleDate = DateValue("Jan 19, 2020")
    MsgBox Year(exampleDate)

    Dim firstDate As Date, secondDate As Date

    MsgBox Films(4, 2)
  </code></pre>
    <b>Functions and subs definition</b>
    <pre><code>
      Function Area(x As Double, y As Double) As Double
        Area = x * ys
      End Function

      MsgBox  Area(3, 5) + 2

      Sub Area(x As Double, y As Double)
      MsgBox x * y
      End Sub
      Area 3, 5

   <b>Application Object</b>
   The mother of all objects is Excel itself. We call it the Application object. 
   The application object gives access to a lot of Excel related options.
   <pre><code>
    Range("A3").Value = Application.WorksheetFunction.Average(Range("A1:A2"))
  </code></pre>
  <p>
  <b>ScreenUpdating</b>
    Sometimes you may find it useful to disable screen updating (to avoid flickering)
     while executing code. 
    As a result, your code will run faster.
    For example, place a command button on your worksheet and add the following code lines:
  </p>
      <pre><code>
      Dim i As Integer

      For i = 1 To 10000
          Range("A1").Value = i
      Next i
      </code></pre>

      To speed up the process, update the code as follows.
      <pre><code>
        Dim i As Integer

        Application.ScreenUpdating = False

        For i = 1 To 10000
            Range("A1").Value = i
        Next i

        Application.ScreenUpdating = True
      </code></pre> 

      <b>DisplayAlerts</b>
        You can instruct Excel VBA not to display alerts while executing code.
        for example,
        . To instruct Excel VBA not to display save alert while executing code:
        <pre><code>
        Application.DisplayAlerts = False

        ActiveWorkbook.Close

        Application.DisplayAlerts = True
        </code></pre> 
      <p>
        (changes will lost)

        By default,  calculation is set to automatic.
       As a result, Excel recalculates the workbook automatically each time a value 
       affecting a formula changes.
        If your workbook contains many complex formulas, 
        you can speed up your macro by setting calculation to manual.
        
        Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual

        you will set calculation to automatic again at the end of your code:
        Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic

      <b>ActiveX Controls</b>
      On the Developer tab, click Insert.

      2. For example, in the ActiveX Controls group,
      click Command Button to insert a command button control.
      
      you can add code to its events and manupulate its properties.
