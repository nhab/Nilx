<h1>SAP Overview</h1>
    <h2>Defenition</h2>
    <p>
        <b>SAP</b> ( <b>S</b>ystems, <b>A</b>pplications and <b>P</b>roducts in data processing)
        is an ERP (Enterprise Resouce Plannig) software.

    </p>
    
    <h2>SAP R3 Architechture</h2>
    <p>
    Contains 3 layers:
    
    <b>Presentation:</b>
    It is a layer where the user work with SAP GUI. 
    It interacts with database layer
    via Application layer.
    
    <b>Application:</b>
    It interacts between presentation and database layer
    It resides in a computer server with multiple CPUs and a vast amount of RAM.
    <b>Database:</b>
    It is a central database that stores all the data of ERP SAP Systems.
    

    </p>

   <h2>Phases of SAP Implementation project(Itrative Proccess)</h2>
   <p>
    
    <b> Project Preparation :</b>
       It includes Building the team: 
       knowing people who have the knowledge of the organization business processes
    
    <b> Business Blueprint :</b>
     includes what modules of a SAP product would be used 
     and the mapping of the existing business processes to the SAP processes.
    
    <b> Realization     :</b> 
     The actual work of customizing the SAP software to be in sync
     with the organizations business processes is done in this phase.
     It includes customization of existing SAP package and solution along with the
     development of new objects based on requirement.
    
    <b> Testing         :</b>
      The changes made in the realization phase need to be tested
      in isolation as well as in a consolidated manner using real-time data.
      This is done in the testing phase
    
    <b> Final Preparation :</b> 
    Certain activities needed to be done directly in the production system .
    
    <b> Go-Live and support :</b> In this stage, the final product is released to the end-users. 
      The go-live may be done in a Big Bang (all modules at one go) or in a phase-by-phase manner.
      support means resolving end users issues.

<h2>What is ERP</h2>
    <p>
        Enterprise resources planning is a software which all tasks of the bussiness are integrated into it.

    <h3>Bussiness proccess integration (BPI)</h3>
        <p>
            Various business processes running in an enterprise and how they are integrated

            <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap/images/business_process_integration.jpg"/> 
        </p>

    </p>

  <h2>Transaction</h2>
    <p>
    Transaction (in SAP) means processing of certain information in order to complete business process requirement
    </p>
    
     <h3>Transaction code (T Code)</h3>
        <p >
            <b>T Code</b> is a 4 digit short cut key to direct access the desired transaction
            from anywhere within the SAP system.&nbsp;
            Instead of using SAP R/3 menu path you can start a function in a single step by using a SAP T-Code.
            
            <b>For example : </b> 
            "customer master record" can be created by transaction code FD03
            or by <b>SAP menu path : </b>
                <pre> SAP menu > Accounting > Financial accounting > Accounts 
                Receivable > Master record > FD01- Create
                </pre>
            <h3>        How to use a transaction Code:        </h3>
            <p>
            1. Log On to SAP
            2. Place a cursor in the SAP command field and enter transaction code and press enter

       </p>

<h2> SAP Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>
    When a company purchases SAP, it comes in a CD in form of software.
    When SAP is first installed, SAP has its standard set up that needs to be configured according to 
    the need of client i.e. organization.
    Configuration of SAP software like add fields, to change field names, to modify drop down lists etc.
    to adjust according to working of your organization is done through implementation guide known as IMG.
    IMG is where we define enterprise structure and other settings.
    
    <b> SAP IMG Path</b>
    To do any type of configuration according to our organization need the first step is to reach the implementation (IMG) guide screen.
    We can reach implementation guide in 2 ways:

     
       Menu path           : 
            SAP Easy Access > Tools > Customizing > IMG > Execute Project 
    
       Transactional code   : 
            SPRO (SAP Project Reference Object)                           

    <b>SAP IMG</b>
    After SPRO, on the next screen click on SAP Reference IMG.

<h2>Master Data</h2>
    <p>
    Data stored in SAP R/3 is categorized as

        Master Data and
        Transactional Data.

    Master data is the core data that is used as a base for any transaction.
        If you are producing, transferring stock, selling, purchasing, doing a physical inventory, whatever your activity may be,
        it requires certain master data to be maintained.

    Example of Master Data

        Material master data
        Customer master data
        Vendor master data
        Pricing/conditions master data
        Warehouse management master data (storage bin master data)
    </p>


<h2>SAP Modules</h2>
     <p>
         SAP has functional and technical Modules

    </p>
    
    <h2>what is a Client?  </h2>
    <p>
        A client is a logical portion of an SAP R/3 physical database. 
        From a business standpoint, a client can be interpreted as <b>a logical group of companies</b>.
        
        <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap/images/client.jpg">
        
        All customizing (configuration) and development (ABAP) work , is performed in a client.
        
        <h3>Client-Dependent vs. Client-Independent</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Client-dependent data</b> 
                is the data specific to an individual client. 
                Examples include number ranges, ABAP variants, and user masters
                 as well as the data that is created or updated through SAP R/3 transactions.

            <b>Client-independent data </b>
                is the data contained across all clients in the system.
                Examples of client-independent data include data dictionary objects (tables, views),
                 ABAP source code, screens, and menus.
        </p>

        <h3>How to determine dependency or indendependency</h3>
        <p>
                Data resides in tables. 
                To determine if a particular table is client-dependent
                 or client-independent, the table structure needs to be reviewed.
                
                The table structure can be viewed by the data dictionary (SE11).
                
                If <b>MANDT </b>(client in German) is the first key field of the table,
                   then the table is client-dependent;
                   otherwise, the table is client-independent.
                
                For example, the TSTC table is client-independent;
                 however, the USR01 table is client-dependent.
        </p>
        <h3>SAP R/3 Delivered Clients   </h3>
        <p>
        Every SAP R/3 system contains at least the 3 clients :
            <b>000</b>,<b> 001</b>, and <b>066 </b> which must not be deleted.
    
        <b>Client 000</b>
           In particular, it is given extended functionality during upgrades.
           Typically, most projects start with a copy of client 000 to begin building configuration.
        <b>Client 001</b>
            is basically a copy of 000 and can be used as a basis for a new customizing client.
        <b>Client 066 </b>
            is a special client which is provided for operational system monitoring. 
            It is used by SAP R/3`s Early Watch Service to provide performance recommendations.                
        
        <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap/images/delivered_clients.jpg" />
        Customer work should never take place in the three delivered clients.

    <h2>Reporting</h2>
    <p>   
        <b>Classical reports</b>
            they do not allow interaction by the user;
           The user must often sort through to find relevant data.
         
        <b>Interactive reports</b>
           allow interaction by the user;
            therefore, the user can produce secondary, detailed lists of the basic list
             by choosing the relevant data and requesting more information.
        
        <b>SAP Query or Ad-hoc Query or InfoSet Query</b> 
            is a tool that allows the end-user to design different queries based on different input and output parameters .
            This is one of the reporting tools majorly used in the HR Module to pull data from the databases. 
            InfoSet Query is suitable for reporting in all areas of the SAP R/3 system.
            
            Kinds of Ad-hoc Queries:
                <b>Basic List</b>  Simple reports.
                <b>Statistics</b>  Reports with statistical functions such as average, percentage, etc.
                <b>Ranked List</b> For analytical reports.
            
        <b>Transaction code used to access ad-hoc Queries</b>
                <b>SQ01</b> − Maintain Queries
                <b>SQ02</b> − Display InfoSet
                <b>SQ03</b> − Maintain User Groups
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Printing</h2>
    <p>
    Kinds of printing methods :
    
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Local printing</li>
            <li>Remote printing (network)</li>

    <h2>General programming</h2>
        <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap/images/general_programming.jpg">
        <p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Module pool programming (or online programming)</b>
                    involves the creation of a module pool (a collection of ABAP modules) and one or more screens.
                    The modules are called by the screen processor during program execution.
                </li>
                <li><b>Batch input processing </b>
                    is used to ensure the safe transfer of data into the SAP system.
                    This process is an automatic, protected data transfer to the SAP system 
                    which uses SAP transactions to validate data as it populates the SAP database.</p>
                    </li>
                <li><b>Common Program Interface - Communications</b>
                    ABAP contains statements that conform to CPI-C standards 
                    These are used for programming communications programs.
                </li>
                <li><b>sequential datasets</b>
                    ABAP can read and write sequential datasets.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <h10>
    To ensure security look after:
        <ol >
            <li><b>Confidentiality</b> − Unauthorized disclosure of data</li>
            <li><b>Integrity</b> − Unauthorized modification of data</li>
            <li><b>Availability</b> − Denial of service (a lack of availability of computing resources)</li>
        </ol>
     In SAP runtime environment, both <b>application security</b> and <b>unauthorized system access to SAP</b> have to be controlled.
    The user accounts are secured by <b>roles</b> that grant authorizations to them. 
    
    SAP authorizations ,control access to 
      transactions (Business Process Activities), 
      or what can be performed within a specific business process step
     by:    <ul>
                <li>- Keeping unauthorized persons out of the system</li>
                <li>- Keeping people out of places where they should not be</li>
                <li>- Safeguarding the data from damage or loss</li>
            </ul>
        
    </h10>

    <h3>Safeguards</h3>
    <p>
        In order to avoid threats the system implements <b>safeguards</b> such as: 
            access control, firewall, encryption, O/S hardening, digital certificate, security monitor, and antivirus.

    </p>

    <h3>Classification of Security</h3>
    <p>
        <ul class="list">
                <li><b>Organizational Security</b> − Related to organization</li>
                <li><b>Physical </b>− Related to the physical assets</li>
                <li><b>Technical</b> − Related to technical threats. This is again dived into 4 types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Program-level security</li>
                        <li>O/S-level security</li>
                        <li>Database security</li>
                        <li>Network security</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap/images/classification_security.jpg" />
        <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Different Layers of Security</h3>
    <h10>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p><b>Authentication</b> − Only legitimate users should be able to access the system.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Authorization</b> − Users should only be able to perform their designated tasks.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Integrity</b> − Data integrity needs to be granted at all time.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Privacy</b> − Protection of data against unauthorized access.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Obligation</b> − Ensuring liability and legal obligation towards stakeholders and shareholders including validation.</p></li>
    </ul>
