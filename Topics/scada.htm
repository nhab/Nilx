<div>
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), is any device that gets data about a system in order to control that system and process data.

A SCADA application has two elements:

    1. The process/system/machine you want to monitor and control. 
    This can be a large scale power plant, a water system, communication infrastructures, 
    a network, oil and gas industries, an automated system, a system of traffic lights, or anything else.

    2. A network of intelligent devices. 
    Interfaces with the first system through sensors, control outputs, and communications protocols. 
    This network, which is the SCADA system, gives you the ability to measure and control specific elements of the first system.

You can build a SCADA system using several different kinds of technologies and protocols. 

Where Is SCADA Used?
You can use SCADA to manage any kind of equipment.
 Typically, systems are used to automate complex industrial processes where human control is impractical.
 Electric utilities use SCADA systems to detect current flow and line voltage and to monitor the operation of circuit breakers.
 State and municipal water utilities use SCADA to monitor and regulate water flow, reservoir levels, pipe pressure and other factors.
 Facility managers use SCADA to control HVAC, refrigeration units, lighting and entry systems. 
 Mass Transit authorities use SCADA to regulate electricity to subways, trams, and trolleybuses; to automate traffic signals for rail systems;
