RankBrain
 focuses on two things:
 1. How long  Google searcher spends on the page (Dwell Time)
 2. The percentage of people that click on the result (Click Through Rate)


Click-through rate (CTR)
 is the ratio of users who click on a specific link 
 to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.
 
 Featured snippets 
  are selected search results that
  are featured on top of Google's organic results below the ads in a box.
  Featured Snippets are gaining A LOT of clicks from the #1 spot.
  how to become featured snippet:
	- Reacher answer to questions or routines
	- Direct answers
	- find:
		Keywords that you already rank for
		Keywords that have a Featured Snippet
		Why is it important to focus on keywords that you rank for already?
		99.58% of all Featured Snippets are from pages that rank on the first
		page for that term.
		So if you don’t already rank in the top 10, you have no chance of 
		getting in the Featured Snippet spot.

  how to make it?
	- Identify a common, simple question related to your market area.
	- Provide a clear and direct answer to the question.
	- Offer value added info beyond the direct answer.
	- Make it easy for users (and Google) to find on your page
