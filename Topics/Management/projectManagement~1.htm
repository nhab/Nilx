Maintaining customer satisfaction 
	Project managers can add a lot of value to the project by building relationships with customers and taking the time to make sure the customer is heard and satisfied with the result. 
Asking the customer questions
	-you might ask if they have a specific vision of the final outcome they would like delivered. 

Building a great team
	- A successful project manager knows that and takes the time to understand each person’s motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.
	-consider the skills needed for the project, as well as the resources available. 
	-bring on people with the right skills and ensure the team knows that each individual is valued, trusted, and appreciated. You can demonstrate how you feel about the team’s value by allowing them to have input and ask questions, and by addressing their needs as soon as possible. 

Fostering relationships
	The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.

	Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.and maintain open lines of communication.

	
	 team members may not know or seee the big picture goal of project.the project manager shhould inform them.this allows them to tailor their tasks to meet the needs of the project end goal.

		. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. 
		Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest.
	Empowering the team

		give them space to show their innovation.
		Allow them to make some decisions.

--------------------------
A project manager’s role within a team
	First, you'll need to hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. Managing tasks will help you hold your team members accountable by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the project. 
	Second, you'll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths. 
		escalation paths, I mean that you should know how you will communicate risks to the right people at the right time. 
 	Third, you'll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles.
	fourth, you'll need to collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget. 
Cross functional teams
	Sometimes the members of a cross-functional team are referred to as “T-shaped professionals.
	” They are skilled in how to collaborate and innovate with those in different job functions and across different departments, but they also contribute their own specific areas of expertise
Clarify goals
	it is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. 
Measure progress
	 This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. 
	You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget.
Recognize efforts
	-As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way
	- Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style
	 can help mediate some of the differences among team members.
