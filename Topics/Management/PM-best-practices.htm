<h2 style="display:flex">What is a Project?</h2>
    <div>
        A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a particular aim, i.e. a product or a service, or result. 
        it may involve research,Analysis, design,production,test and maintainance.
                
    </div>
	
 <h2 style="display:flex">main characters of a project:</h2>
    <div>
    • Temporary : Has a defined beginning and end.

    • Progressive elaboration: Continuously improving a plan as more detailed and specific information become available .

    • drives change: in organizations (sectors) to move from one state to a better state.

    • It is a mean for achieving an organization’s strategic plan.

    • Project can create a result i.e. a product or  a service. 

    • Creates business value .

    </div>
 <h2 style="display:flex">What is Project Management?</h2>
<div>
    Project management is the application of knowledge,methodology and skills  to project activities to 
    meet the project requirements and the project overal goal.
    methodologies includes proccesses,best practices,check lists, principals,documents,roles amd more.
 </div>
 <h2 style="display:flex">Managing projects includes:</h2>
<div>
    • General Business Management (consistently producing results expected by stakeholders)
    • Leading (establishing direction, aligning resources, motivating)
    • Communicating (clear, unambiguous, and complete)
    • Negotiating (conferring with others to reach an agreement)
    • Problem Solving (definition and decision making)
    • Distinguish causes and symptoms
    • Identify viable solutions
    • Influencing Organization (understanding power and politics)
    • Requirements identification.
    • Define clear and achievable objectives.
    • Balancing the competing demands (scope, time, cost, quality, risks …).
    • Adapting the specifications, plans, and approach to the different concerns and expectations of 
    the various stakeholders
</div>
 <h2 style="display:flex">The project life cycle:</h2>
<div>
    o Predictive (plan-driven approaches): where the product and deliverable are defined at 
    the beginning and any changes to scope are carefully managed. Also referred to as 
    Waterfall life cycle

    o Adaptive (change-driven approaches or agile method): where the product is developed 
    over multiple iterations and detailed scope is defined for each iteration only.

        § Iterative: the scope is determined at the beginning. However the cost and time 
        are routinely modified as the team understands the product more.

        § Incremental: the deliverables is produced through series of iterations that 
        successively add functionality within predetermined timeframe.

    o Hybrid: is a combination of predictive and adaptive life cycle.

 Project Life Cycle defines:

    o Technical work performed in each phase
    o Who is involved in each phase
</div>
 <h2 style="display:flex">Project phase</h2>
<div>
    Phases are generally time bounded with start and ending or control point

    • Project Phases are marked by the completion of a deliverable (tangible, verifiable work product)
    • Review of deliverables and approval/denial are “phase exits, stage gates, or kill points”
    • Phases are collected into the Project Life Cycle
    • Phase-to-Phase relationship:
        o Sequential relationship: Starts only when the previous phase is complete
        o Overlapping relationship: a phase starts before completion of the previous one
        o Overlapping is a “Schedule compression technique called Fast Tracking”
    The development life cycle can utilizes various models: Predictive, Iterative, Incremental,Adaptive, and Hybrid
</div>
 <h2 style="display:flex">Project Management Processes:</h2>
<div>
    The processes are  logically connected and linked. Usually the process produces one or more outputs, and the output could 
    be deliverable or input to other process.
    Each process is characterized by its inputs, the tools and techniques that can be applied, and the 
    resulting outputs
    • In order for a project to be successful, the project team must:
    o Select appropriate processes required to meet the project objectives;
    o Use a defined approach that can be adopted to meet requirements;
    o Comply with requirements to meet stakeholder needs and expectations;
    o Establish and maintain appropriate communication & engagement with stakeholders;
    o Balance the competing constraints
</div>
 <h2>five Process Groups:</h2>

    • Initiating,
    • Planning,
    • Executing,
    • Monitoring and Controlling, and 
    • Closing.

 <h2>Initiating Process Group</h2>

    • Defines and authorizes the project.
    • Are often done external to the project’s scope of control.
    • Facilitate formal authorization to start a new project.
    • Project manager assigned
    • Funding and approval happens external to project boundaries
    • Many large or complex projects are divided into phases, and repeating it for each subsequent 
    phases.

 <h2>Planning Process Group</h2>

    • Defines and refines the objectives, and plan the course of action required to attain the objective 
    and scope that the project was undertaken to address.
    • Develops project management plan and refines project scope, project cost and schedule.
    • It is updated and refined throughout execution process group by rolling wave planning.
    • All necessary stakeholders are involved in this process.

 <h2>Execution Process Group</h2>

    • Majority of the project budget will be spent in performing Executing Process Group. 
    • Integrates people and other resources to carry out the project management plan.
    • During the project execution, results may require planning updates and re-baselining

 <h2>Monitoring & Controlling Process Group</h2>

    • The main benefit of M&E Process Groups is that the project performance is measured and 
    analyzed at regular intervals.
    • Monitoring the ongoing project activities against the project management plan and the project 
    performance measurement baseline
    • Influencing the factors that could circumvent change control or configuration management so 
    only approved changes are implemented.
    • Controlling changes and recommending corrective or preventing action in anticipation of 
    possible problems.
    • M&E Process Group not only monitors and controls the work being done within a Process 
    Group, but also monitors and controls the entire project effort

 <h2>Closing Process Group</h2>

    • Formalizes acceptance of the project or phase deliverable.
    • Obtain acceptance by the customer or sponsor to formally close the project or the phase
    • Conduct post-project or phase-end review
    • Record impacts of tailoring to any process
    • Document lessons learned
    • Apply appropriate updates to organizational process assets.
    • Achieve all relevant project documents in the PMIS to be used as historical data
    • Close out all procurement activities
    • Perform team members’ assessments
    • Release project resources
