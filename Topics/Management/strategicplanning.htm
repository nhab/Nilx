<h2 style="display:flex">1. Understand the need for a strategic plan</h2>
<div>
<p>
The first and perhaps most important step of the planning process is understanding that there is a need for a plan. In terms of management, this means that you need to be aware of the industry environment in which the business operates so that you can identify opportunities for development. You must also be aware of the business’s internal operations so that you will know when there is a problem that needs to be solved.

After you have identified opportunities, you can begin looking at actions that would help you take advantage of those opportunities. For example, perhaps the government is offering contracts for businesses in your industry. If you are aware of this, you can make a plan to help your business compete for a bid.

<p>
Setting goals is the second step of the strategic planning process. Goals can be set for both individual departments and for the business as a whole, depending on their purpose. Continuing the example of using government bids, a company-wide goal could be to secure the bid. Meanwhile, a department goal would be to improve specific performance metrics, such as sales or customer satisfaction. 

A goal for an organization can be general, but when you are setting goals for a department, you need to be detailed and specific so that your team members will understand what they need to do. For instance, while increasing profits could be a goal for the business, the individual departments will need more detailed goals related to boosting profits, such as “We will generate an extra $5,000 in revenue by April 24.”

Goals are vital to the strategic planning process because they allow managers to more effectively direct their teams. They give employees a common purpose to work toward so that their daily activities will be more focused.

<p>
When you make a plan for your business, it should be done with the future in mind. Of course, the future is unpredictable, which means your plan will need to be based on certain assumptions or premises. 

A forecast is a common type of premise that involves making certain predictions about the future. If the company’s goal is to increase profits, management would need to forecast whether or not that the industry would be able to support an increase in profits.

During the strategic planning process, you will need to develop both internal and external premises. Internal premises are based on the inner workings of the company and factors. Some examples of internal premises include:

The resources you expect to have available
Company policies that you need or will have to implement
How the levels of management will interact with the plan
External premises are anything outside of the company that may affect the plan and the ability to achieve set objectives. Some examples of external premises include:

The political and social environment
Technological advancements
Competition from other businesses
When trying to achieve an organizational goal, it is important that all managers are operating under the same premises and that they agree with the premises.

<p>
There are usually several different ways to achieve a goal. You will need to take the time to research various ways your team could work toward completing a set objective. Researching different solutions for completing a goal is important because it gives managers some flexibility when they are directing their teams. Some managers may prefer innovative solutions for completing goals, while others may wish to use more traditional methods.

When researching different ways to achieve objectives, the goal should be to narrow options down to a few choices. As we mentioned, there are likely countless solutions for achieving the goals that have been set, and if you do not narrow down the options, it will be hard for your managers to choose a solution that works.

Once you have identified a few of the best ways to potentially achieve your goals, it is time to closely examine these solutions to decide which is the best option. You need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each solution, particularly as they relate to your business’s set goals. Imagine that you are developing a financial plan for your company. For every possible plan, you would need to evaluate the risks of the plans as well as the potential returns. You would also need to analyze each option you consider to see if it would help you efficiently achieve your final objective.

<p>
Once you have set your objectives, developed your premises and identified or evaluated different solutions for completing your goals, you can then decide which course of action to take. Ideally, the strategic plan that you choose is the one that will be the most profitable. Before you choose your plan of action, there are a few things you will need to keep in mind: 

Avoid a plan that could potentially cost the business money. This is something to consider whether it’s in the short term or the long term.
Be sure that you select the plan that has the least amount of potentially negative consequences. Every plan you can choose will naturally have drawbacks, but some plans will have more disadvantages than others. Compare the different options for completing your goal, and choose the one that has the highest chance of success.
Choose a plan of action that is adaptable. While you are executing your plan, you may encounter obstacles that you did not anticipate. If your plan is flexible, you should be able to overcome these obstacles more easily than with a plan that’s fixed. For example, if the business is pursuing a government bid and the government institutes a new policy, you may need to alter your bid so that you can comply with the new policy.
When you form a plan of action, you should largely base your decision on concrete evidence, such as mathematical analysis. That said, your experience as a manager can also help you decide which plan is best for accomplishing your set objectives. Drawing on your personal history, you may realize one of the plans being considered is something you have seen implemented in the past and that you know to be effective. 

You can also take elements of various strategic plans and use them together. For example, if you are comparing two financial plans, perhaps one has a better solution for increasing profits and the other contains an effective strategy for shielding the business from unexpected losses. You could combine these two elements to create one strong plan.

<p>
Once you know which plan you are going to implement, you may also need to develop a secondary plan to help you institute the primary plan. Secondary plans will vary depending on your objectives, so you should keep your goals in mind while developing this additional plan.

If your objective is for your company to launch a new product your main plan may include steps, such as product research, developing a marketing plan and arranging for manufacturing. The secondary plan will include all the steps that you need to take to support the implementation of the main plan.

For example, you might need to expand your product research team, which means hiring new employees could be a step in your secondary plan. Similarly, you may need to hire a product research team if your firm does not already have one or increase your company’s manufacturing capability if your current facilities are not suitable for the new product. Training personnel is a common component of a secondary plan regardless of the goal. Whether you are trying to launch a new product or want to increase sales of a current product, your staff will likely need further training before the company will be able to achieve these objectives.

<p>
The final step of the strategic planning process is implementing the plan. In some cases, this can be the most involved step in the planning process depending on the objectives you have set. When it comes time to implement a plan, managers draw on their skill set and experiences to make sure everything runs smoothly.

If the organizational goal is particularly complex, managers will need to take the time necessary to make sure their team members understand their responsibilities and how everyone connects to the larger goal. All team members need to be informed and work together to make the project successful.

The tools you will need to implement the plan depend on the specific circumstances. For instance, if your plan is related to instituting a new company policy, implementation of the plan will require consulting with the legal department to make sure that the policy is outlined correctly so that it will be effective.
