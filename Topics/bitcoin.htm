blockchain.info or coinbase.com. 

If you elected to BIP38-encrypt your wallet, 
you may need to recover your unencrypted WIF
 "Wallet Import Format" private key 
by using the "validate" tab on this web page. 

-by downloading one of the popular bitcoin p2p clients 
and importing your private key to the p2p client wallet.

 Keep in mind when you import your single key to a bitcoin p2p client 
 and spend funds your key will be bundled with other private keys
  in the p2p client wallet.

 When you perform a transaction your change will be sent 
 to another bitcoin address within the p2p client wallet.
 You must then backup the p2p client wallet and keep it safe
 as your remaining bitcoins will be stored there. 
 Satoshi advised that one should never delete a wallet.
