Upload Your Audiobook & Cover
You’ll upload your book description, choose a category for your audiobook,
 upload your audio and cover, and submit to ACX for their review. This is covered in the “All About ACX” section below.
 if non-exclusive publication deal with ACX to go on any of these platforms:
 Overdrive distributes to libraries, which could be a good opportunity to get your audiobook distributed even more widely. 
 However, Overdrive is very selective in choosing which authors to accept, 
 and typically you’re going to need at least a dozen or more audiobooks recorded to even get your foot in the door.

Audiobooks.com is in second place behind ACX in terms of audiobooks sales, but ACX is way out in the lead!

Downpour is another platform that’s right behind Audiobooks.com in sales. Both of these platforms, 
however, are going to require you to negotiate a deal to be published on them, 
while on ACX you can simply upload your book and start selling audiobooks.

options[i++]={title:"Audiobook Marketing",body:`Once you’ve created your audiobook and its live for sale on Audible and iTunes, you’ll have a unique opportunity to market your audiobook. About 7-10 days after your book is live, you’ll get an email from ACX with 25 free promotional codes that you can distribute to anyone you like. This is a superb opportunity as the perceived value of an audiobook is high (and it should be since the shortest audiobook sells for $3.95!).

As such, you need to maximize this opportunity to distribute these codes in order to do things like:

Build your email list
Gather reviews for your audiobook (obviously full disclosure is needed by the reviewer as well as compliance with Amazon’s Terms of Service, but this is still a great way to get reviews)
Reward loyal readers and customers
Now, you should know that marketing an audiobook is still somewhat in its infancy. And, unlike Kindle Direct Publishing, ACX really has no built-in promotional methods like the Kindle Countdown Deal or free promotional days for your Kindle eBook.

So essentially, you’re going to have to work harder to promote your audiobook. But with far fewer audiobooks published compared to Kindle eBooks, if you wisely work the marketing end, you can get ahead of the relatively smaller competitive field.

A fundamental strategy for marketing your book is to gather reviews as noted above. How can authors get reviews?`,parent:objGrp}
options[i++]={title:"Free Audiobook Promotion Sites",body:`Goodreads Audiobooks Group → Great place to get solid reviews of your audiobook and audiophiles tend to gather here.

Reddit Audiobooks Thread → On Reddit forums you can post your book but be aware that Reddit can get nasty (I’ve seen it happen) so you must ensure your book is excellent before posting! That said, I’ve had good results with Reddit for my audiobooks as this is a well-traveled subreddit.

Facebook Group for Audiobook Giveaways → Although Facebook group marketing kind of sucks for eBooks, this specific group currently has over 6,700 members and you can distribute promo codes here. With this group, though, you can’t post more than three total giveaways for any given book.

Facebook Group Everything Audiobook → This group is smaller but still has 3,000 members and its another place you can distribute promotional codes for your audiobook.

Facebook Group for Audiobook Promos → One more place to post your free promotional codes on Facebook with 2,500 members.

Christian Audio → If you have a Christian-themed audiobook, you can simply post it as a suggested title for them to host on their site by including the book title, author’s name, and a quick reason why they should include your book.`,parent:objGrp}
