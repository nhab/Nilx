  body:`
  a Kindle Keyword should be a phrase or word that:

        1.   Shoppers actually type into Amazon

        2.   Shoppers will actually pay money for

        3.   The competition isn‚Äôt too hard

  title:"Step 1: Finding Kindle Keywords ,People Actually Type into Amazon",
    body:`
    Amazon created a function in their search box that
     guesses what you are going to type into it 
     based on the popularity of particular terms from other shoppers 
     typing things into it ‚Äì the autofill function.

    But to get those, there are a couple of steps you should take:

    1.   Ensure you are using Incognito mode on your browser 
        so that your previous information doesn't affect what Amazon shows you.

    2.   Select ‚ÄúKindle Store‚Äù or ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù as the Amazon category. 
        You want to know what is popular in your industry
         and not be shown products or terms other than book terms.
         <img src='https://nitrocdn.com/YTibXMIwXCUkXtfHFnkSuEHUqRRKKBBW/assets/static/optimized/rev-3873c3d/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Selecting-a-shopping-category-for-kindle-keyword-research.png' />

    3.   Start typing in a word, and look to see what Amazon immediately pre-populates in the search box.

    4.   Once you've found a phrase that you're interested in,
     add each letter of the alphabet at the end of your word/phrase, and see what comes up.

    An example of Step 4 is:

    ‚ÄúScience Fiction a‚Äù‚Ä¶then, ‚ÄúScience Fiction b‚Äù‚Ä¶then, ‚ÄúScience Fiction c‚Äù‚Ä¶

    And so on‚Ä¶
    You would do this with every letter of the alphabet ‚Äì even ‚Äòz‚Äô ‚Äì
     and look to see how Amazon completes your search phrase.
 
    make sure that none of the phrases you have is something that violates Amazon's Keyword requirements 
    (it's under the ‚ÄúKeywords to Avoid‚Äù section). 
     Just because Amazon suggested it, doesn't mean you can target it.

    Now, the above steps don‚Äôt tell you how popular they are;
     they only tell you that people type this into Amazon. 
     If you‚Äôd like to know how many people type those words into Amazon, you‚Äôd need a tool like Publisher Rocket. 
     
     <a href='file:///C:/Users/npc/Desktop/Kindle%20%20marketing%20plan_files/image002.png'>Publisher Rocket</a>
      will not only list all those keywords for you, 
     it will also tell you how many people type it into Amazon ‚Äì thus giving you better information.

options[i++]={
  title:"Step 2: Find Kindle Keywords That Shoppers Will Actually Pay For",
  body:` There are some terms out there that might get a LOT of searches but just don‚Äôt get sales. 
  To find out if a kindle keyword is making money,
    first, do a search for that keyword in Amazon.
    Then click on the top three books that show up for that search.
    Next, go to their <b>Amazon Best Seller Rank</b> (ABSR), copy, and paste it 
    into <a href='https://kindlepreneur.com/amazon-kdp-sales-rank-calculator'>Kindle Calculator</a>.
    This calculator will convert the ABSR of a book or kindle into estimated sales that day.

    If the three books ranking at the top of Amazon don‚Äôt make any money, 
    or less than other keyword options of yours, 
    you now know one of two things:

    1.Not many people search for that keyword ‚Äì thus, low sales

    2.People who do search for that keyword didn‚Äôt find what they were looking for and didn‚Äôt buy.

    Now, go through your list, repeat,
     and see which of your keywords are not only getting searched, but also making sales.

    The right kindle keywords can make or break your book sales. 
    Choose wisely with these steps,

    Alrighty then‚Ä¶now that we know which keywords get searched and help to sell books, 
    let‚Äôs take a look at the level of competition and see if we can get our foot in the door.

  title:"Step 3: Check the Kindle Keyword Competition"
  ,body:`If 1,000 people type into Amazon ‚ÄúHow to write a book‚Äù per month,
   then statistically speaking, 270 will click on the book that shows up at the top,
    but only 60 will click on a book that shows up #6.

   As you can see, we NEED to beat the top ranking books (1-5) in order to benefit from the kindle keyword shoppers.
 


   Book Covers: 
   A great looking book cover design is super important. 
   If the book cover design stinks, but that book is making sales, then GREAT! 
   Verify that you can create a cover better than what is there.

  Titles and Subtitles: 
    Is the keyword in the title or subtitle?
     If so, then know the author is targeting this term strongly.
      Also, does the book title or subtitle make sense? 
       Here are two articles to help you craft a bestseller book title, and a subtitle that converts.

  Book Reviews: 
    How many book reviews do they have?
     Are they recent or super old?
      Are they verified or unverified? 
      What rating do they have? 
      Having better and more reviews than your competitors is a sure fire way to get the sale over the competition.
       Here‚Äôs a great tactic to help you increase your reviews legitimately.

  Book Description:
     Book descriptions are more important than people think.
      It‚Äôs what makes shoppers click to buy. 
      It‚Äôs that last-ditch act of convincing shoppers they need to buy the book.
       So, is their book description well written, 
       or are they structuring their book description so it looks presentable,
        like my free Book Description HTML tool will help you do?

  Age: 
    Newer books usually still have a lot of Amazon love, 
    and are usually doing big marketing pushes. 
    So, their numbers and popularity are a little inflated.
    
    However, if the book you‚Äôre competing against is years old and still crushing it on the market, then beware!

  Author‚Äôs Popularity: 
    If the author is super famous or has a large following and email list, then they are really competitive. 
    First, go to their Amazon Author Page and check their author rank.
     You can also do a Google search for their name,
      and look at the website (use this) to figure out if they are getting people to their website,
       look at their social media and see if they have a huge following,
        and just get a general feel for how much this author is invested in the subject matter.

  After looking at the level of competition, you should have some terms/phrases that not only get searched, 
  and bring in money, but they won‚Äôt be too competitive for you to use and get in front of a buyer‚Äôs market. ‚Äì Congrats!

  If you're not sure how to figure this out how competitive something is based on the above, 
  or it seems like too much work, Publisher Rocket will actually do all of that for you.  
  It looks at the information, and gives each keywords a score from 1-100 on how hard it would be for your book to rank for that term.

  title:"3 ways to convince Amazon your book should show up for those keywords:",
  body:`
  1. Your 7 Kindle Keywords : In your KDP dashboard, 
  Amazon will ask you to give them 7 kindle keywords where you can fill each to over fifty characters each 
  (that's fifty different letters and spaces total).
   Go ahead and put your well-chosen keywords here. 
   I highly recommend that you don‚Äôt stuff a bunch of keywords into this area ‚Äì regardless of what others recommend. 
   Amazon is a lot more competitive than it used to be, 
   and I personally think that you shouldn‚Äôt dilute the strength of your keyword push by throwing other words in there. 
   You did some great research ‚Äì stick by that.

2. Your Book Title or Subtitle:
 Having the keyword phrase in your title or subtitle is a great indication that your book is about that. 
 I‚Äôm not saying you should just ‚Äòstuff‚Äô a bunch of words in there‚Ä¶no no. 
 But remember that Kindle Keywords are the words your target shopper uses when looking for their next book.
  A great way to get a customer's attention is to use their own words. 
  So, keywords can be great for helping you improve your sales copy üòâ

3. Your Book Description: The same goes for your book description. 
There is debate, as to whether or not Amazon checks for Keywords in the description, 
but I am of the belief that they do, since their algorithm A9 says so on their home page. 
However, like I said in #2 above, keywords are the words your customer used to describe what they wanted 
and a good book description should convince them this IS the book they want. 
If Amazon continues to see that when people type in a specific keyword, they buy your book,
 Amazon will wise up and realize, you‚Äôre the best product for that keyword üôÇ

   title:"Make a giveaway contest",
   body:`
   4. A Giveaway Contest that is Legal!!!
 you need to ABSOLUTELY follow these steps in order to stay compliant with Amazon.
But when done right, this tactic is extremely killer!
What you do is create a giveaway contest. 
In this contest, if they click the link that points to your book‚Äôs review page (see special link discussed above),
 they are automatically entered into the contest. That's it.

This works because, when they click the link, 
many readers will decide to leave a review since they are already there.
 This is compliant in Amazon‚Äôs eyes because they are entered in the contest by just clicking the link, 
 not by submitting a review.  
 Therefore, the review is not incentivized.
   You can see an example below on how to word this for best optimization as well as staying compliant.

Step 1: Build a giveaway
Step 2: Make it clear that to enter the giveaway, 
they just need to click the link that points to your book‚Äôs review page 
Step 3: And that‚Äôs it.

How to Build a Giveaway
There are two ways to build a giveaway:

1. Use Your Email System: 
You can send out an email blast to your readers with the instructions on how to do this. 
With most email systems like <a href='https://kindlepreneur.com/click/convertkit'> ConvertKit</a>,
 you can mark which subscribers clicked on the link in the email. 
Then when the time is up, you can select from there.


2. Use <a href='https://kindlepreneur.com/click/kingsumo'>KingSumo</a>: This is a paid app that is around $49 for life,
 but it makes creating contests SUPER simple. 
 Furthermore, it handles the legality issues on contests,
  and you can post links to the contest on Social Media, email,
   or even embed it on your website.
    You can check it out <a href='https://kindlepreneur.com/click/kingsumo'> here</a>.

   title:"Create Special Links to Go Straight to Your Review",
   body:`One mistake many authors make is when they request for someone to give their book a review, 
   they just send the person a link to their book, 
   making the person click around till they finally get to the review page where they can write the review‚Ä¶yeesh, 
   that‚Äôs a lot of steps!

Because of this, readers will more than likely not follow through. 
I know I haven‚Äôt in the past.

However, what if there was one special link you could send them 
that would take them straight to the review of your book? 
All they‚Äôd have to do is click, and they start writing the review.

Well, you can and here‚Äôs how:

Step 1. Depending on the format you want the review to be directed to, 
either find your ASIN for the eBook, or the ISBN -10 for the book (NOT ISBN-13), or the ASIN for the Audiobook.

Step 2. Take the following link, and add your number from step 1:
http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?&asin= + (ASIN or ISBN 10)

Step 3. The above link is only to the US market.  
If you want a different market, 
you need to just change out the ‚Äú.com‚Äù to the appropriate one like ‚Äú.de‚Äù for german, or ‚Äú.co.uk‚Äù, and so on. 
 However, be sure to check that country's ASIN or ISBN-10 for that same book‚Ä¶because sometimes it will be different 
 ‚Äì although this is mainly for published books and usually isn't the case for self-published books. 
  But just check ‚Äì you don't want your links to not work.

Example of What The Result Should Look Like:
US: http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?&asin=B0041JKFJW
UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/create-review?&asin=B004H4XAXO
DE: https://www.amazon.de/review/create-review?&asin=0765365278
etc‚Ä¶

As you can see, that will take you directly to The Way of Kings Audiobook review,
 since I used the ASIN for the audiobook. (PS: I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson, 
 and will be meeting him in a couple of months to discuss book marketing‚Ä¶fan boy scream).

Now, any time you request a review in an email, message, 
or whatever, send them that special link to your book. 
That way, all they have to do is click the link and type the review. 
You‚Äôll have a much higher chance that they‚Äôll follow through and leave the review.

Caution: Your Link Not Working? First, if your link isn't working, 
just remember that Amazon won't allow you to leave a review for your own book. 
So, have someone else try your link.  
Also remember that in order to leave a review, someone needs to have made $50 purchase on Amazon that year.

Also, for the rest of the steps below, make sure you use this link when necessary.
 That‚Äôs why it is the first point in this list.`
