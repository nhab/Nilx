<b>Resume writing</b>
   0- your resume must be rated above 80 in resumeworded 
otherwise hr and recuters even dont see your resume.
it sounds ridiculous but even a  dot can change your resume rating
1. Define your career goals
<p>What job,position and company you want?</p>
2. Find job listings from diffrent sources
3. shortlist the companies which suite your criteria 
<p>(for example:being mid to big level,technologies they use,their captital and personnel satisfaction)</p> 
4. Create a customized resume for each job based on the needed skills in job description:
<p><b>Your job title</b>: under your name,write 3 skills which are most needed in the job description(of course you must be skiled on them)</p> 
<p><b>Your profiles section</b>: summary of your hard and soft skills and career highlights and your education and certificates</p>
5.Proof of your profile:
<p><b>Your experience section</b>Show your practical experiences by example in the skills they want,company-wised or project-wised.</p>
<p>It is not needed to write mass of skills in skill section,it can instead be shown in your career history,which is referencible.</p>
<p>It is good to refer to a website,people or certificate to prove what you say.</p>
6. Apply massively but Rationally and Research companies you want to apply for
7. Write a tailored cover letter

<p>
how it differs from resume: is  written for a specific job :
   how you fit the position :
		technicaly:
			- by hiring you,What problem would be solve?
			 the problem of the company already is described in the the ad.

		company's culture:
				 - Google around for the company and its field of job 
					, and sprinkle some cool historical facts into your cover letter 
				 
				 - survey the culture of the company; The tone should match the company culture :
				 - what is organizational chart and structure  
				   who is key persons/how they physically seperate themselves from other?
				   where is thir office?...
				   

		personaly( your intrest in the type of job and the company and your personality)
			- personal tagline:Make your opening line memorable not introducing yourself again:
			Try opening with a favorite short anecdote, a quote that best describes you as a professional, 
			 or your personal tagline.
			 Example of tagline:
			 "I am innovative, inventive, original, and resourcefulā€¯
			 "I have always ideas about the ways to reach a goal, increase productivity, or solve a problemā€¯
			"always full of new ideas, although I can detach and rest whenever needed. ā€¯
			"I can think out of the box when everybody thinks there is no more solutions"
