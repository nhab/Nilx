        body:
  `
  <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/common">Common Functions</a> 
    are the following functions: Print(), Alert(), Comment(), MarketInfo(), Sleep(), etc.
    
  <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/array">Arrays</a> 
  
    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/convert>Conversion functions</a>
    This is a group of functions that provide conversion of data from one format into another.

    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/math">Mathematical Functions</a>
    Standard set of mathematical and trigonometrical functions.
  
    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/strings">String Functions</a>
    String functions are used for processing variables of string type:
     searching value, concatenation of lines, retrieval of sub-lines, etc. 
     Conversion functions are used for converting a variable of one type into another type. 
     NormalizeDouble() function rounds off values of double type to a certain accuracy.
  
     <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/dateandtime">Date and Time</a>
     This group of functions is used for getting time information in this or that form: 
     LocalTime() shows the local time of a computer, TimeCurrent()
     shows server time of the last received quote. 
     Besides, parameters like a weekday, month day, hour, minute, etc. 
     can be obtained for an indicated time value.
   
    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/check"> State Checking</a>
    Functions that return parameters of the current state of the client terminal
    
    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/series"> Timeseries and Indicator Data</a> 
    They provide access to price data of any available symbol/period.
    

    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/customind"> Custom Indicators</a>
    These functions can be used only when writing custom indicators.

    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/indicators">Technical Indicator Functions</a>
    A group of functions intended for calculation of standard and custom indicators.
For an Expert Advisor (or any other MQL4 program) to take up the value of any indicator, 
it is not necessary that this indicator is present in the chart.
 The requested indicator will be loaded and calculated in the thread of the module that has called it.
Any indicator can be calculated on the data of not only current chart, 
but also on the data of any available symbol/period. 
If data (symbol name and/or timeframe differ from the current ones) are requested from another chart,
 the situation is possible that the corresponding chart was not opened in the client terminal
 and the necessary data must be requested from the server. In this case,
 error ERR_HISTORY_WILL_UPDATED (4066 - the requested history data are under updating) 
 will be placed in the last_error variable,
 and one will has to re-request (see example of ArrayCopySeries()).

All indicator functions have at least 2 parameters - symbol and period. 
The NULL value of the symbol means the current symbol, the 0 value of the period means the current timeframe
    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/chart_operations">Chart operations</a>
    A group of functions that are used for 
    getting information about the current chart,
    to which a program in MQL4 (script, indicator or Expert Advisor) is attached.
    The functions defining the chart properties 
    are actually used for sending change commands to the chart.
     If these functions are executed successfully, the command is included 
     in the common queue of the chart events. 
     The changes are implemented to the chart when handling the queue of the chart events.

    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/marketinformation"> Market Information</a>
    functions intended for receiving information about the market state.

    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/objects">Graphical Objects</a>
     This group includes functions that are used for programmed creation 
     such objects as well as for changing their properties, moving them and deleting.
    

  <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/files">File Operations</a>
    This group of functions is necessary for reading/recording data on a hard disk.
    For security reasons, work with files is strictly controlled in the MQL4 language.
    Files with which file operations are conducted using MQL4 means cannot be outside the file sandbox.
    There are two directories (with subdirectories) in which working files can be located:
    terminal_data_folder\MQL4\Files\ (in the terminal menu select to view "File" - "Open the data directory");
    the common folder for all the terminals installed on a computer - usually located in the directory 
     C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\Files.
    There is a program method to obtain names of these catalogs using the TerminalInfoString() function,
     using the ENUM_TERMINAL_INFO_STRING enumeration:
    
    
  
  <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/globals">GlobalVariables</a>
    Functions for working with GlobalVariables.
    Global variables of the client terminal should not be mixed up with variables 
    declared in the global scope of the mql4 program.
    Global variables are kept in the client terminal for 4 weeks since the last access,
     then they will be deleted automatically. 
     An access to a global variable is not only setting of a new value, 
     but reading of the global variable value, as well.
    Global variables of the client terminal are accessible simultaneously
     from all mql4 programs launched in the client terminal.
    When testing and optimizing the Expert Advisors that use global variables,
     keep in mind that client terminal and the Strategy Tester share common global variables. 
     Therefore, the names of the global variables must be different from
     the names of the global variables used by other mql4 programs.
     Otherwise, it may lead to incorrect work of mql4 programs and inaccurate testing results.

  <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/account">Account Information</a>
    Functions show information about a client terminal, account and check the current state of a client terminal 
    (including the state of environment of MQL4-program being executed).
  
   <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/trading >Trade Functions</a>
    Functions for conducting trade operations.

    <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/signals">Trade signals</a>
    This is the group of functions intended for managing trade signals. The functions allow:
        get information about trade signals, available for copying,
        get and set the signal copy settings,
        subscribe and unsubscribe to the signal copying using MQL4 language functions.

magic - Order magic number. May be used as user defined identifier

I.e., when an order is being placed (a position is being opened), 
one can assign a unique number to it. This number will consequently 
be used to distinguish the above order from others.
  There is no use (or even possibility) applying this feature when trading manually, 
  but it is really unexpendable when trading using an expert (automated trading).


Example 1: A human trader and an expert are trading 
in the client terminal at the same time. 
Task: The expert must trade according to its algorithm and 
may not do anything with positions opened manually.
Solution: The expert must assign a unique, non-zero MagicNumber
  to the position being opened. In future, it must manage only positions, 
  the MagicNumber of which is equal to the preset one.

Example 2: Two experts with different algorithms 
are trading in the client terminal at the same time.
Task: The expert must manage only "their" orders.
Solution: Each expert must use its unique non-zero MagicNumber

In future, they must manage only positions,
