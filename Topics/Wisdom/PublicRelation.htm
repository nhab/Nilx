- The <h7>power of silence</h7> is the key to the relations to others.

- Being cunning or political is something compeletly different.

- It is just not to be stupid in these ways:
 1-By being silent you don`t trough the power of your information
to the outer entities and people which
you don`t know what they will do with the power you gave them.
they may judge you,or misuse the information.

 2- If what we want to say is about what we dont want,
 why shoud we focus on it?
 Instead we can control the stupid anger and be silent.

3- you don`t waste your potential energy by throughing it away 
  and you save it to do something perfect and feasable.
